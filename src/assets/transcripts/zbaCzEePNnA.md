Just got back from Illinois locked the front door oh boy got to sit down take a rest on the porch. Graduation sets in pretty shoe I'm seeing dude Looking Out My Back Door. There's a comet doing cartwheels statue wearing high heels look at all the happy faces dancing on the wall Nassau Patrol and listening to Buck Owens Look Out My Back Door. That's life. That's what all the people say when you're riding high. In April. You're shot down in May and I know I'm Gonna Change Is That Tune when I'm back on top back on top in June I said that's life as crazy as it may seem. Some people get their kicks from stopping on a dream and I know that if it's that way this is July I'm Gonna Roll myself up in a big ball and die bye bye bye but up eyes mashed potatoes do the alligator Batman and the Mississippi River in the back road. Yeah.

Foreign got in touch with Chris and suggested the topic and it was something I actually had something. I wanted to say about so thank you to whoever suggested this because I think this is interesting they wanted to know about the white. If I had any opinions of the White House plumbers show which is now on Max. We love Max don't we folks. We love our content. Sluice give me a slewis of content and I'll be happy so it's interesting so I started watching the show. What strikes me is how unhbo it is and so I remember oh right. They already made a off no thank you this that that is some. the Twitter neuroses projected back into the past get it out of here but since I'm watching White House Brothers I decided what would be interesting you know watch them back to back so every episode of White House bombers. I've been watching the equivalent episode of Gaslight afterwards and it's fascinating so if you had taken the labels off of these shows and I didn't know anything about them and you maybe watch them and said which one is the HBO show and which is on one of those you know.

Johnny. Come lately is like stars or epic or whatever the fun I would have said oh. It's this Gaslight show it has bigger Stars. It's got Julia Roberts. It's Martha Mitchell. It's got Sean Penn is John Mitchell It's got a more traditional sort of prestige narrative and character base so because it's got Martha Mitchell as you know the put upon wife who's speaking truth to power. But it's also got us a subsidiary protagonist John Dean who you know over the course of the movie or of course. The show falls in love with the liberal and finds his conscience and all this so it's a more conventional show from a point like with point of view characters that the audience is meant to sympathize with start. The White House plumbers you know you got woody harrelsonian but it's Justin throw you know. This is not on the same level of of prestige cast and also it's from their point of view. Like those are the point of view characters is Lydia and mostly e Howard hunt a guy who the the movie the show is like kind of inching up towards suggesting helped kill Kennedy which has been the most interesting part of the show. White House plumbers is that it seems to be taking a pretty astringent like point of view as opposed to just being get a load of these goofballs.

Although get along these goofballs is the main enjoyment but what strikes me is like these shows came out back to back and yet they they were developed like um distant apart from each other in time enough that they represent two completely different epochs of of like culture pop culture. Prosper understanding of like the moment in politics so Gaslight is like 100 a product of the Trump Administration. popular culture of Hysteria and panic like oh my God Trump is a monster. Trump is going to kill us all we have to stop him. We have to come Together As Americans and recognize that this is not Who We Are and like having calling it gaslit and making the centerpiece of it being Martha Mitchell getting slapped around by her security guard so she doesn't tell anybody about what's going on It gets that feeling there's even a moment which just made my took my breath away when Martha Mitchell is arguing with John Mitchell about Nixon and she's like. Nixon. He's got small hands. She says Nixon has small hands which is not anything anybody ever said about Nixon. That's the thing they say about Trump very obvious. Very like this is Trump. We're doing a trump analog and we're trying to get you to rise to your better nature.

You pig like Americans whereas buenos glamorous feels very much like a Biden era show where like Trump has come and gone the world is still here shittier but basically the same and we're all vaguely embarrassed and more than anything we recognize. Our institutions is filled with pathetic losers at every level and that it is a squalid and not a Shakespearean world that we're trapped in and that is most exemplified by the the performances of the two G Gordon ladies. so Justin throws G Gordon lyddie and Lighthouse plumbers and he is doing it as a a relatively surface level like a buffoon. A a guy who is very full of himself very pompous but also incompetent a very Cohen brothersy type of take on Liddy just like he's got this kind of fake plummy accent and he's just takes things very seriously while also being an idiot and a Nazi which they point out very clearly and so it's it's you know. It's funny. But it's also one-dimensional Shea. Wiggum plays G Gordon Lenny in gaslit and he is buffoonish and funny at times. But he is also terrifying like I there's like a snake-like demonic aggression coming off of him and the way that they treat Lydia and his penchant for putting his hand over flames and burning himself to show his will in White House plumbers.

I don't think they they show him with the with the Band-Aid. On I don't think they ever show him like actually doing it. At one point. He does it to show how much he's gonna not like he's devoted to not turning on on the president after getting arrested and he blows out the candle but on glasslite. The very first shot is of G Gordon. Lyddie holding the hand over the flame and reciting this you know Nazi speech about how will alone is what you know pulls Humanity out of the the chaos of uncreation and you know all that stuff and and he's scary. He's like clearly someone who would kill and maybe have killed in the name of what he calls it. The kingdom which is you know the white supremacy fascist Republican party that trump-era culture was freaking out about and so they may he has to be scary because he is the Boogeyman that this sort of politics represented by Nixon but really represented by Trump has within it and and which will be. Unleashed by these guys being unchecked by outside powers and other powers like the Democratic Party whereas I think that that danger in White House plumbers has been defanged a little bit by the experience of what is what are these people really capable of and you know the answer is January 6th with a lot of people were freaked out about but which in hindsight I think those of us who say this is a bunch of goofballs blowing off steam have been Vindicated by like it didn't even set off some sort of stochastic violence campaign. You know now you know they're still capable of petty grieving Petty tyranny fascism and mass shootings that's going to keep happening but you know that's just like. It's like climate change. That's like microplastics infiltrating our genome and and like what cutting our life expectancy you know. It's. It's part of the general decline era that we find ourselves in. It's not an apocalyptic rupture foreign lasso.

Protestant humor not just Protestant humor Mormon humor. We can't forget um when Mitt Romney dressed like Ted lasso to give a Halloween present to his girlfriend Kristen Cinema globo moremo. I mean they do have Global power and they've gotten into the very highest ranks of American power and influence they wanted it more literally. They they hustled they created a a mythopoetic relationship to American capitalism that was less internally conflicted than that of their fellow American Protestants oh okay. So that's White House buffers. I'll I might have more to say when it's over. But for now that's my impression and it's kind of interesting to me. And I do say it's enjoyable but so far it's like sort of been you know sort of like with thoreau's performance surface level. The most interesting thing is this teased element that like this is actually about the Kennedy assassination much way the which is much have the same way as how Oliver Stone imagined Watergate. As as blowback from the Bay of Pigs. Thing I read two out of the three three body problems. I will read the third one soon all right.

So I got some more of these I opened one of these Gulf War sets and there's some good ones in this one. So I wanted to do a quick deck because there's at least one in here that I remember being very fun. So first we got a warbird the old F-14 Tomcat. This is this is Mavericks. This is Mavericks ship. What do they call them jet highway to the danger zone highway to the danger zone. Gonna have a dog fight in the Mediterranean with maybe. It's Libya who knows air boat are they called air boats so the F-14 Tomcat baby launched from either a carrier or a ground base. The Tomcat is a multi-role aircraft with a sophisticated radar missile system that enables it to simultaneously track 24 targets while attacking six with its Phoenix missiles. It can select and Destroy targets up to 100 miles away powered by two turbofan engines with 27 000 pounds thrust wow it can fly higher than 56 000 feet. There are 114 Tomcats deployed in Operation Desert Storm. We love something that has multiple roles.

I think they got rid of that right or seemed like for a while. They were just stuffing all the rolls into one like that's what happened with the Bradley. Fighting Vehicle too you know they try to make one thing everything have they gone. It seems like they've kind of gone back away to to more specialized stuff. But I don't know I think they're like with the F-35 I think there are different types of the F-35 with different specializations. If I'm not correct if I'm not incorrect. I think so what's so some of this okay. This is very interesting. Someone is saying that the F-14 was decommissioned in part because it was not multi-role didn't. They figured out other ways to do roles and the F-14 wasn't rolly enough. The F-18 came along was like Hey you thought you were multi-role I am quad quad multi-roll. You manufacturer good old Grumman Corporation I guess. This is before the merger speed Mach 2.

 0.3 max range 576 miles Armament 20 millimeter gun four Sparrow missiles or eight Sidewinder missiles or six missiles or six Phoenix missiles and two Sidewinder missiles. I would go if I'm doing my Loadout I'm doing six Phoenix and two Sidewinders you know to give me options crew two yeah who you're gonna intercept well that what who are you intercepting there's no intercepting to do all right. Here we go. We've got military skill the phonetic alphabet. Any any Wilco fans out there will know what this refers to the phonetic alphabet over the radio. Some alphabet letters sound alike to avoid confusion U.S soldiers substitute words for letters a message giving map coordinates. Z72b would be spoken Zulu 7-2 Bravo and here we go Alpha bravo charlie delta Echo foxtrot golf Hotel India Juliet kilo lima mike November Oscar papa Quebec Quebec really Romeo Sierra Tango. Uniform Victor whiskey x-ray Yankee and Zulu love to call white trash Whiskey Tango that's always fun golf. Here we go oh.

It's. It's the judicial system everyone. It's the judicial system. It's just a picture of the Supreme Court Building. It's the judicial system getting really abstract. Here. A unique feature of the US government is the power of the Judiciary oh brother don't. We know it oh boy. We sure do know that granted by the case of Barbary versus Madison in 1803 an amazing piece of jurisprudence where the Le the Judiciary ruled that it had the right to review legislation. Just said hey I get to do that and the thing is in a closed system like that new adaptations to the the deliberative structure are going to come internally. Someone is going to claim the Reigns and it'll be it'll always end up being the Judiciary because they are separated. They have that that barrier between them and direct politics which means they can be trusted by Elites more which means they have more latitude to act unilaterally. Elected leaders will always be checked by Capital before they really change the rules of the game in any way. But you can trust the Judiciary to hoard power because they will rule in favor of existing power you know that the the Warren Court was really a mirage that that obscured the real relationship between the court and American democracy and that was because you know we were. There was this necessary liberalization of of social order necessary to accommodate a fully integrated Global capitalist country and not just anyone but the number one one the the chairman of the board. The reality of living being the global hegemon is that that particularism of the of the of America of the White America was no longer tenable and it wasn't going to come from legislation. It was going to have to come from people who didn't have to worry about voting. Getting voted on and those were Progressive changes. They had a progressive character. They're necessary for any sort of effective class politics to exist because otherwise you could just divide racially the working force and forbid the sort of solidarity that becomes power.

But it was not because of you know some greater virtue of the justice system but liberals have now. Liberals are being disabused of that but it's been very difficult for them to get it through their minds. The judicial branch is one of three equal parts of the government complementing the executive and legislative branches. The Judiciary has the power to rule on the legality of laws as well as to make judgments on cases from the top down. The Federal Judicial System is divided into three tiers the Supreme Court. The federal courts and the district courts and here we go. We got another one of the one of the members of the coalition.

The UAE UAE folks we got the UAE UAE United Arab Emirates. unites seven sheikams. They gain their independence from Great Britain in 1971. During the 19th century this area was called the pirate Coast oh cool and based its economy on shipping and pearl diving. I think I think piracies got to be in there. Somewhere I have read endgame by Derek Jensen. That's one of the first radical political texts I got when I was like in high school. Today oil rains and the United Arab Emirates enjoys one of the world's highest per capita incomes. It is a member of the United Nations and has taken an active role in Operation Desert Storm. They're just going Opera active role. They're there they've got a pen it they're waving it back and forth geographic area. 32 000 square miles population 7.6 million. How many of those are native languages Arabic Farsi and English predominant religion good old Sufi Islam eighty percent only interesting probably because there's she in the Eastern provinces of Saudi Arabia too Capital Abu Dhabi government. Type Federation with power shared by central government and sheikams interesting way to phrase that the head of government prime minister Rasheed IBN Saeed Diego Garcia Carl Diego Garcia the Diego and Garcia. That's one of those Empire Islands. They got in the Indian Ocean I believe Diego main island of the chagos. Archipelago has been part of the British Indian Ocean territory since 1965. Located they got I'm not going to read it.

They have its coordinates if you want to call in a bomb strike. Diego Garcia has no permanent civilian population and is the site of a joint anglo-american Naval Communication Center during Operation Desert Storm Diego Garcia served as an air base for B-52 bombers. It was discovered by Portugal in the early 16th century ah the Portuguese geographic area Oscar's geographic area because there's nobody in there 10.5 square miles Give It Up to Diego Garcia folks where would we be without them. Here we go these plates are always cool in movies. we got a military asset the E3 Sentry a-wax. This is a surveillance guy with the big dish for monitoring information these guys got cooked at the beginning of Independence Day if anyone remembers that E3 Sentry a wax a militarized version of the Boeing 707. The E3 Sentry was an essential tool of the Airborne combat operations in Operation Desert Storm.

It's rotating radar Dome and monitor everything that moved on the ground or in the air as far as 250 miles away. U.S and Allied air attacks were likely directed by the 20-person mission crew of the century. Ah. That's nice they they were likely direct me. One of these might have called in the strike that blew up the Baghdad bomb shelter that killed 300 civilians wonder if they got a medal for that one manufacturer good. Old Boeing Aerospace speed 545 miles per hour max time on station. Six hours primary functions Airborne surveillance command control and Communications crew 17 to 23. Here we go the t72 see the t-62 main battle tank here. This is one of those Russian Bad Boys that the Iraqis had the Russian tanks can't really beat the Russian tanks just such a striking profile on those bad boys. a Soviet built main battle tank. The t-62 is similar to the American M60 Series in size and armaments. The Iraqi tank is slightly faster but has less armor protection than the usmbt. The t-62 has a larger main gun. 115 millimeters versus the M60 is 105 millimeters. Oh ouch it fires at a slower rate. Four rounds per minute compared to six rounds per minute for the usm60 suck.

It we get boom boom boom boom boom we're blasting off baby. It's not as much force but it's it's quality. It's quantity over quality. That's the American motto and honestly that might be it manufacturer good. Old USSR speed 31 miles per hour range. 280 miles armaments 150 millimeter gun one 7.62 millimeter machine gun one 23.7 millimeter machine gun for anti-aircraft defense and crew 4. Interest okay.

This should be juicy intelligence file Middle East history present. It's Middle East history presence. I don't know what that means we're present from. It's the it's the history of the present. We are present for the history kind of or we present ly Middle East history. Don't get it one key to understanding present Middle Eastern events okay so they are saying it's the history of the present is Arab nationalism ain't that the truth the Arab world is divided over whether to unite under a single principle political entity for the benefit of power and therefore recognition. Crucial to peace in the Middle East is for America Western Nations to acknowledge Arabs for significance. Beyond terrorism camels and oil the Hussein's and qaddafis will continue to rise because they represent the hopes of people who consider themselves ignored and mistreated oh that's interesting so they're saying that U.S policy in the Middle East is creating hostility to the United States and solidarity among its people and eventual military and political power through the Hussein's and the qaddafis NASA of course being the OG of this. yes good old Arab nationalism on the Wayne here in 91. We've done our much we. We've done all we could to destroy it yeah because the thing about like that kind of nationalism and the developmental context is it's pretty necessarily socialist to some degree or another because the only way you modernize is through Sovereign control of capital distribution if and the story if you're not setting the conditions of of development in your country in your political capital. Then you are going to be turned into a tin pot potemkin country that masks a foreign extraction regime and this is of course one of the big reasons that the United States and with its Partners in Saudi Arabia carry off their gladio B program of funding arming and supporting and propagating radical Sunni fundamentalist Islam as a way to annihilate the secular political projects represented by Arab developmentalist nationalism and then they do something like have a blowback like 911. It's like it's not really anything that was not intended and in fact at one level of Consciousness or another that I'm not sure of but definitely existed sought and desired This is an interesting question if we did have a pan-arab republic where would the capital be well. The natural answer would be Cairo because not only is it. The you know the the most capital of the most populous Arab state. But it is the cultural capital of the Middle East. Egyptian. culture like television and movies and stuff is the most watched. The Egyptian um dialect is the one that you're most likely to hear in entertainments in the area. But for that very reason maybe you'd want to go somewhere more neutral like Nasser tried to start that process by building the United Arab Republic between Egypt and Syria. But eventually the some faction of of syrians were not going to want to have their sovereignty claimed by somebody in Cairo. So it would probably have to be a third New City built somewhere. Maybe it could be oh you know what maybe it will be the line maybe that can be the capital.

Here we go we got leaders. We got Javier Perez Celia Javier. We got our U.N General Secretary is he is he the general secretary yes the Secretary General. The United Nations selected to be the fifth Secretary General of the United Nations in 1962. Javier Perez de esteliar has spent many years in the Diplomatic service of his native country Peru a member of the Peruvian delegation at the first general assembly of the U.N in 1946. He was later appointed Peru's U.N representative in 1971. Although superb International negotiator hmm he is unable to resolve peacefully the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait which resulted in Operation Desert Storm sorry buddy you. It up. We got to come in there and save everyone's ass by kicking it born in Lima Peru birthday January 19 1920. That guy's dead right yeah education the Catholic University of Lima and finally another Arab country to join in the Coalition and the one that started it all really them the real kind of villains of the whole piece. the with the Border before Operation Desert Storm began Kuwait accompany accompanied accomplished three stunning. Feats own 20 of the world's known oil reserves qualified as the world's second largest exporter of oil and allowed the Sheik to get half the profits of oil sales. Oil revenues permit a wide range of free social services for Kuwaiti citizens who pay no taxes during the ran Iraq war 1980 to 1988. Kuwait sided with Iraq geographic area 6880 miles population 2 million language Arabic and English predominant religion Islam. Although they're not specifying this time capital of Kuwait City. It says Kuwait but it's Kuwait City government type nominal constitutional monarchy. You know it's nominal. All right and the head of government is the Emir Sheikh Jabar al- Ahmad al-sabah.

There we go the the Sheikh that launched a thousand scud missiles Scar Tissue with the misuse is alone when bloody blood alone. I think that might be the first time I've ever done a Red Hot Chili Pepper song and not a very good. One too don't know why that got my head all right. We got one more pack. Here. I have been I guess I've been californicated. I think that's the only explanation we've got here a military asset. The f 46 Wild weasel I think Israel will probably use nukes at some point yeah. I mean I think we're going to use nukes at some point. I think neither one of us are going to be able to handle the possibility of dismantling our power base because the base of our power is the metaphysical understanding that it will never be relinquished because we would not do what we do We would not have the will to do what we did if we ever thought that we would face any sort of vulnerability because how could we expect. Anyone else not to take our weakness as an opportunity to get some get back to get some Revenge. Now I'm not saying that necessarily has to happen. But I am saying that that is the assumed like visceral subconscious belief that powers everyone in any position of authority in the United States and it's because they can't bear to imagine a Reconciliation on any terms and that's what drives them forward towards annihilation. So I don't think any either country is built to say no to that temptation. But we'll see we'll see can't know for sure.

So we got this guy. this guy's the wild weasel I play the Wild weasel for many a year. I spent all my money and whiskey and McDonald Douglas. Phantom f11 airplanes an evolution of the F4 Phantom 2. The F4 G is responsible for suppressing enemy radar sights get out of here radar. It does this by detecting and analyzing hostile radar signals when a Target is acquired a high speed anti-radiation missile harm is launched to destroy the enemy site once the F4 G is destroyed enemy air. Radars other aircraft fulfill their objectives you know harm is a pretty It's too badass a name for a missile that's just supposed to blow up radar dishes like that's basically a missile that knocks over mailboxes and it's called harm that's metal that should be something that like fragments into like living nanoparticles that dig into the Flesh of anyone who's near the explosion and it like gets into their bloodstream and turns their blood into caulk that's a harm missile. By the way we probably have those things manufacturer McDonald Douglas speed Mach 1.2 max range 262 miles combat Armament 20 millimeter cannon harm Sparrow shrike or Sidewinder missile and bombs missile wet bombs missiles and door bombs crew of two survival that is a military skill.

I would argue. It's the most basic of military skills if you don't have this one covered. If you don't have a good handle on Survival. You might want to consider another line of work. Many situations in combat may leave soldiers. Semen or Pilots cut off for the main group with no supplies surviving survival training and Equipment will help them get keep going until help arrives or they can return to Friendly territory or their own them on their own. The most important aspect is survival. According to instructions in this U.S military survival kit is keep your head. Native tribes live for Generations in the open air taking their living for nature. You can do the same hmm. We'll see how many of these guys have ever done that best of luck and remember that courage alone has won. Many a Battle. I don't think that's the case okay we got another. One of these fat social democracies that's just getting rich and indolent off of a global killing murder machine.

It's a tick on the back of the of the rampaging Rottweiler of the world system Norway for more than two centuries. Early Norwegians or Vikings ruled the North Atlantic controlling islands near Scotland Greenland and Iceland as well as Norway occupying the Northwestern part of Europe Norway stretches across Northern boundary of Scandinavia bordering the USSR. It's a charter member of the UN Supply. The naval unit congratulations 125 181 square miles population of 4.2 million language Norwegian predominant religion Evangelical Lutheranism Capital Oslo government type constitutional monarchy. The head of government prime minister Jan seder Sis Sis sys I gotta get bifocals. My eyes are going rip to me. I honestly don't know I might have had this card before. But I think it was Denmark very similar.

Except they got oil intelligence file chronology of events ooh very important very important that you have the events chronologically arranged if you want to understand what came first. On July 18 1990 Iraqi president Saddam Hussein accused to Kuwait of stealing 2.4 billion dollars worth of oil from an Iraqi field talks over oil prices at a disputed border broke down on August 1st Before Dawn on August 2nd Iraq invaded Kuwait and soon threatened Saudi Arabia. Unprecedented World cooperation spearheaded by the United States led to sanctions and finally war on January 16 1991. So there we go somebody says events 10 do tend to happen one after another I notice yes you notice we all notice we all perceive them as happening one after the other. But in fact all events happen simultaneously. We just are not in a position to perceive them that way.

We got General. We got a leader. Here we got a leader. We got a real leader. We got a StreetWise Hercules who's gonna lead us to Victory he doesn't at all look like a human's. Skeleton General Alfred M gray look at this guy very well named man that is the greatest looking dude I've ever seen. He is a terrifying gray man and I don't really like it. He looks like I'm looking at him with the they live glasses right. Now. Not a fan of this guy looks creepy back. The back picture is like closer unnerving don't like it don't like his face don't like him looking at me General Alfred M gray Commander United States Marine Corps enlisting as the U.S Marine Corps in 1950. Grace served overseas with FMF Pacific attaining the rank of Sergeant before being commissioned second lieutenant in April 1952. As a major. He joined the 12th Marines and served in Vietnam. He Advanced to Brigadier General in March 1976 and was promoted to Major General in February 1980 and Lieutenant General on August 29 1984. Gray was promoted to General and became commander of the Marine Corps on July 1st 1987. Wow went up from the enlisted man didn't go to Officer school interesting very rare.

They got to keep that wine track beer track working class professional class boundary somehow and the getting a commission which is just a modernized version of the feudal thing of getting authorization from the King to raise forces on your behalf and on his behalf. Born Rahway New Jersey Night USA Baby Jersey boy birthday June 22nd 1928. So this guy's probably dead too right probably him got I'm gonna put it down there. Anyone want to confirm that I bet he's dead you went to the North University Northfield Vermont USA and Lafayette College and Eastern in East I guess. He got a degree eventually graduate of command and Staff College Army work challenge army war challenge okay. Anyway.

He creeped me out and we got another country Honduras Honduras Honduras The Good Old Republic of Honduras. In 1502 Columbus discovered Honduras on his last Voyage to the new world. In the first part of the century U.S Marines intervened on two occasions. The Civil War in Nicaragua 1981-1990 spilled over into Honduras when the Contra Rebels used Honduras as a training training area. The U.S also used Honduras as a site for military exercises what a coincidence what a coincidence. Those two things were Honduras supplied economic assistance to Operation Desert. Storm. Economic assistance is Honduras. It's one of these countries that where we denied any ability to democratically allocate capital and created this potemkin state and drained their lifeblood by turning it into a site of essentially feudalism if not slavery and then they have to pay us to blow up a country in the Middle East to maintain their oil dominance. God damn brutal geographic area 43 277 square miles population 5.1 million language Spanish predominant religion Roman Catholicism Capital taguchigopa government type Republic head of government president Rafael Leonardo.

All right here we go we got a m113 armored personnel carrier yeah baby. We love to carry Personnel in an armored fashion. We're just going to be driving these around the streets of the United States in the next five years and half of them are going to be. Electric. They put out more carbon to make and maintain than a fleet of Gremlins a fleet of AMC Gremlins but you know what they're you plug them in so you're a good person more. more than 50 Nations employ variations of the m113 for their Armed Forces. This light less than 11 tons aluminum armored vehicle is powered by a diesel engine. The m113 can carry 12 combat equipped troops or up to two tons of equipment fully amphibious. It can cross inland waterways traveling at 3.6 miles per hour using its tracks for propulsion manufacturer FMC Corp speed 40 miles per hour max range 300 miles Armament one 12.7 millimeter machine gun and a crew of two with 11 troops every town yeah.

Every cop every police office in America has one of those now the military skill range. I assume this is practicing your gun if it is there's no gun. It's just an empty field. It's an empty football field is that the Cowboys there's a Cowboy stadium. This is very abstract. I don't know what this could possibly mean range estimating the range oh okay and they're using that as a way to read range hmm. Estimating the range or distance of objects is one of the most difficult and indispensable skills for a soldier to learn U.S soldiers often estimate the number of American football field lengths. There we go we've got to be about football baby to judge distance. Objects seem closer if they are brightly colored. The weather is clear. The sun is in front of the objects or they're seen from the sea. Their range appears farther if they are dark. There's Fog rain or Haze. The sun is behind the objects or there is camouflage. It's tough folks if you need to assassinate anyone while they're playing football in Dallas. It's difficult to get the range we've got reconnaissance. This is another thing that you got to have for intelligence. It's it's just a. It's one of those is that even I think that's the a-wax or it might not even be. I don't no. I don't think it is. I don't see the dish. A French word reconnaissance refers to actions that provide timely accurate information about the enemy and the terrain controlled by the enemy. This information is vital to making tactical decisions. Reconnaissance is often shortened to Recon many military plane satellites ships and other vehicles are designed for this important purpose. It's right that's right. It's very important. What you do don't feel like you're a loser just because you're running around looking for things and not actually up all right.

 wow we've got a real. We've got a goat on our hands here. Let's go. It's we're talking goat time in terms of survivors in the insanely Cutthroat realm of of Middle Eastern politics. We got haifa's Assad the guy who kept it who held it the whole time and who has his kid even though he's chosen. Heir got wiped out his ophthalmologist kid. His ophthalmologist second son gets thrust into the spotlight and he holds on to it I'm not the first person to say this ever. But Jeremy Strong should absolutely play Bashar Assad in a film and you could even you can honestly argue that he is basically playing Assad on succession right. Now I mean looks identical has the same vibe but his dad the dad the the the Logan of the Assad Clan. The president of Syria Assad was an active participant in anti-french demonstrations during World War II. After Syria became independent from France in 1946.

He continued to be politically active and joined the Arab bath Socialist Party. Around 1943 nominated defense minister. In February 23. 1933. He retained his position as commander of the Air Force. All Assad was elected president of the Syrian Arab Republic by a public referendum on March 12 1971. That's so nice of them and he got that treatment because he signed on to the war yeah yeah yeah you're but you're basically the same guy as Saddam Hussein but you're coloring within the lines. Even though there's kind of good evidence that he's the one who actually did the Lockerbie bombing. He knew how to make himself pliant enough to the powers that be to avoid saddam's treatment and so he gets to be. He gets to have a public referendum born Syria birth date March 1930 education Elementary in kirdara Syria Secondary School in La Katya Latakia Syria Air Force College Syria.

That's the guy good old heifers he held on and he he passed it on and none of that is good good for him but yeah better than the alternative you could be arguing and that's the real tragedy and the fact that the fact is the fact it has to be remembered is that these context is being set at every level by the United States. Like everybody else is having to make decisions in a greater context of American hegemony and that constant pull to break open your your country's economy like a coconut and feasting on the meat and hollowing you out and preventing any any Capital to stay in the country. The air profit rather a minimal profit like that is the directive of international american-led finance as it encountered the rest of the world and the post-war era and the directive was the same everywhere minimize. The amount of profit that stays here maximize the amount that comes to the United States and the only thing that prevents that is the resistance of the institutions of that state and where they could resist. They did and they held on and where they could not.

They didn't and they were hollowed out. So everybody is operating in that context and so everybody who we consider a monster of this era is acting out of a a necessity to hold power in a situation where the the Spaceballs are sucking the oxygen out of your country. They've got the giant spaceship with the vacuum cleaner. How are you supposed to behave France somebody's talking about France's relationship to their colonies in Africa. That's a wild situation because the French really did They're the ones who were the most reluctant and I think it's because they were the farthest of the three main I guess no I'm sorry. The US like did not have a formal Empire. By that point other you know comparable to the European powers. But by the end of World War II the top two were England and France. England was closer to us. France is closer to the outside.

It had also been invaded and occupied by Germany and have basically been racked by a Civil War. And fascism the Dutch to you the the French kicked and screamed the hardest I mean how many times did De Gaulle almost get killed. The British were relatively happy to let go compared to the frogs and part of that the legacy of that is that they weren't content to just say all right fine. You're independent now good luck with that oh. What's that you need money hopes. They wanted more significant guarantees so there's a french-backed currency in the former French McGrath that that they're obligated to use so that means that there's their monetary policy is held in Paris directly not through intermediary institutions like those for other countries part and parcel of France's attempt to carve out a zone of autonomy within the greater NATO Power structure because they're always too big for their britches.

They're always the biggest boy on the Block. The actual block of Europe most population and most robust agriculture before Germany United. Of course oh yes the Portuguese yeah. They really wouldn't let it go under under the oldestado novo so much so that the Army itself had to say this and carry out a left-wing coup Carnation Revolution. We talked about that before I mean I don't think France has really been like out of I don't think France has not been militarily involved in Africa. Ever at any point. I don't think it ever stopped intervening and militarily in Africa. Those forces have been active that whole time for in some way or another fighting somebody Gaddafi. What have you and now it's really the British who are the most most plangently anguished by the loss of their empire because it's finally sunk in what the climb looks like they like it okay tell me quick. I haven't read the end of the world as just the beginning by Peter zahan. But it sounds intriguing I just Googled it. Oh baby.

Somebody asked if there's any chance of electoral reform in the United States. we're actually the only thing I can think of that might ever happen in the near future and we're kind of close. We're not a few states away from it is enough States passing the national popular vote compact. They're pretty close Minnesota just joined you flip a couple of houses. You could do it in like the next couple of election. Cycles for those who don't know what that is it is a piece of legislation. That's that states can pass through you know their legislatures and then have the governor sign. It that says if states that add up to a majority of electoral votes all signed this legislation. Also then our state will instruct the legend. The state government will like instruct its electors to vote for whoever won the national popular vote irregardless irregardless of the vote in the particular state. Although honestly if they tried that I don't know what would happen I mean talk about waving a flag at the bull but that's one that I can actually see something happening but you know like abolish. The Senate. Anything that would require a constitutional amendment is literally inconceivable in the current conditions. The sort of unanimity. The sort of bipartisan consensus that you need on major issues to pass a constitutional amendment is unthinkable.

I mean it's very fitting that the last one that passed was about Congress can't raise their salary until they have an election coming up or some. Like oh. They're making too much money in Congress yeah. That's where the corruption comes their paychecks and that's of course Congress. All those little demons in the political system are happy to pass that oh these Rubes think our salary is what matters yes sir. We're not going to raise those taxes oh well. Meanwhile they're eating endangered animal meat at the cafe at the child zoo of their billionaire benefactors. Foreign people say like they actually need to pay Congress people more.

But I think the real solution is good old sortion but that's in a context where class conflict has been removed and you're administrating rather than sublimating class Conflict at a ritual which is what we do in this country assortion. It means having people selected by lot yeah. Congressional jury duty foreign but you know this is a perfect example of why no reform will ever really be a Magic Bullet and it's not really something to focus too much on when you're this behind the eight ball. As we are is that you can imagine a bunch of reforms making voting you know a a better a better able to reflect like what people's opinions are and their will but what that will is is already shaped fully by the class forces which means that the actual navigatable band of political choice is already radically restricted. So changing the makeup of the electorate can have only a limited effect on that and like if you just took a system we have now and replaced the Congress. We have with sorcian your your congressperson for two two years and that's it then the existing structures that reproduce power would just adapt to that because you got a bunch of just regular people showing up in Washington with no idea what the going on who's going to tell them what's happening other than creatures of the system yeah. No I think that that we are really going to see the the states live up to their reputation as the as brandeis's Laboratories of democracy But it's gonna be much more about like meth labs of democracy and that's means. Some states are going to get some pretty terrifying legislation and but some other ones are going to see new possibilities open and as as always the hole in the center is just going to keep bigger get bigger and bigger yeah. Now. I don't even think we'll get the divorce we'll stay together for the kids I.E the US dollar and the U.S military and 5 000 nuclear missiles and the NATO and all that you know just the idea that there's like a Bill of Rights that that means the same thing in every state will just not exist anymore.

There will be bespoke bills of Rights. There will be bespoke understandings of public public legality but the experience of living in all of them will largely be determined by your class. Voting will be done by people moving and the poorest everywhere will suffer pretty similar levels of debasement. Somebody said that it's hilarious to think that default is going to happen and I do understand that yes every everything in the system says no don't do that like nobody in it actually wants it except for probably a few dullards in the house. But the technicians at Chernobyl didn't want to blow up the plant that wasn't what they were doing those tests for not great not terrible. It happened because there was a chain of ups that nobody was aware of that had undermined the system stability to a level that no one had recognized until it exploded because like they'll probably get a bill together but even that they're pushing it. If they get a bill together.

It cannot be one with just Republican votes and there are plenty of Democrats who feel like they can't sign off on what the Republicans are going to get out of these negotiations and of course if you could say oh they're going to give in of course. They're going to give in. That's what they're you could you could say it's because they're sellouts. But it's really because they feel responsible and they don't want to be responsible which is not what you have in the Republican caucus. They don't care not all of them but sufficient of them to make it so the actual will of every person of influence and power throughout the entire deliberative process is unable to push it across the goal line. Now at that point do the Democrats break the glass that they put around themselves. Mime Style maybe that level of exigency would make them do it maybe something that they could do. They wouldn't do anyway just because of a internal taboo which are real. They are as real as anything else who knows I don't know I've given up predicting. I think they'll probably make a bad deal freeze on spending some cuts on something. But it's going to be close and it's going to involve probably multiple votes as they try to Wrangle this caucus that like cannot be wrangled they got a veto. They got a one vote veto on this vote for speaker but like people talk about if they do the coin thing that is one of those options that might be real in an abstract sense but is not real to the people that matter they don't perceive it the same way you do their life experience. The experience that put them in that room and you on the internet makes to them that possibility an impossibility not not something that they could do but are choosing not to do but something that they are internally prevented from doing through a lifetime of reinforcing experience.

Oh man sequestration that was fun. We're probably gonna get some version of that again. That's what happened the last time. This occurred under a bungler and it's when you consider how many people are now have. Oh bungler negotiations when the party was even was like when the Republicans were less the range than they are now. They made a deal where it was just a broad across-the-board cut of spending including some defense spending which was kind of amazing and then It was like a dead man switch like if they did not come to a deal. Then it would get cut automatically and they cut it for a while but then it just went away as soon as Bush got it or as soon as Trump got in. There just went away. They just like forgot it if you like social spending you kind of have to root for. Republicans don't you because you could say oh they cut it well. Everybody cuts it you know everybody Cuts programs. Clinton ended welfare as we know it. But there's much less pressure to actually cut in the forget what they put in the budget what they actually comes out of the out of the legislative process. When you don't have Democrats in power. I could see a sequestration maybe that did not touch the military this time. So less of a compromise they're gonna have a hell of a time getting those Rubes though to vote for it I don't know maybe they don't need them that many the discharge position petition thing never went anywhere and I guess. It's because even those you'd you'd think oh those moderate like you know Tri-State Democrat Republicans who won Biden who won Biden districts. In 2022. They don't want to have the debt ceiling go kablooey true but they also have to get renominated by a Republican party that has wrapped itself around these absolutist positions and they don't want to be a name on a discharge position that's with every other Democrat. At least I assume that's what happened maybe that maybe it didn't even get that far who knows whatever happens well. You can be sure that it will be really stupid.

That's the one guarantee we have we might invade Mexico. We'll see certainly. It's. It's on the eschatological bingo card. That's for sure so I asked about that. that drug cartels don't exist book which I haven't read. Yet. I've heard is very good. I'm intrigued by the prince by the by the concept because I always like that sort of reframing thing. Although I always I I'd always assume that like the plaza system for a while was real anyway like you had that you had you know divided territories. But I could definitely see an argument that it broke down just into relative Anarchy in the last 20 years.

Amlo is fighting for his life right now indeed amlo take my energy so far from God so close to the United States. Thing is now we're in a state thanks to the world getting flatter where pretty much every country on Earth can say that someone really wants to know what I thought the biggest Catalyst for the U.S for the working class losing the class war. I know I think it's possible to recreate class consciousness. I have talked about that a lot I think about it a lot like where's the Tipping Point where's the hinge point LOL and you know. It's somewhere in that early 20th century conflagration between the beginning of World War One and the end of World War II and I mean you might say oh you know. It was even doomed then and you might be right. But you know those questions can only be settled through open. Force open contests of force which is what we finally got on the global scale from 1914 to 1945. As to whether we can recreate it I don't think what we understand as class. Consciousness can really be recreated but that does not mean that the human collaborative Holy Spirit cannot reconsecrate a relationship to the self and others that binds and and and points towards cooperation solidarity survival and eventual victory. I just don't know what it'll look like I do think it's being built under our feet right now though the Spider-Man Whopper oh I like that transition what makes it. Spider-Man is it food coloring or something oh a terrifying red bun.

Yeah. I don't like that not a huge Burger King fan in general. I will I do tip the cap that they have. They are the only fast food place that goes with the grill Flame Grill kfabe and then they put in that flavor to make you feel like hey. This is like a this is like a cookout Burger. You know cookout does that too shout out but nationally I mean but not that good not that great. It's always a little chewy yeah. The impossible Burger is not bad. I think honest I think that we might never get a plant-based McDonald's burger because they didn't have to adapt first because they're the market leader and because changing that direction of a ship that big is incredible you meant so undertaking so guys like Carl's Jr and and what Burger King got in there and I think they've all kind of lost money on it. I don't think it's been terribly successful. I think that's because the sort of virtue that you are selling when you're selling a non-meat fast food doesn't translate to a person who is in the mode of consuming fast food because there's two reasons to go plant-based right. There's ethics and health and the fast food experience really militates against anybody who is overly concerned with either of those things like we hit the number of people who are like I really want to eat a burger. But I I don't want it to be a dead animal and also I don't want it to be. Taco Bell I want I'm at Burger King I honestly kind of think the Burger King or it's interesting Del Taco out here in California. They have the plant-based everything they got the pan-based tacos plant-based burritos. None of that for Taco Bell and some people say it's because they're already plant-based like there's no meat in that beef and you know what I honestly wouldn't be able to tell the difference because it's just such a deep proustian resonance. The entire Taco Bell experience. So by the time you know McDonald's is like gearing up to do it. They look around at the market and they're like oh. There's no percentage in this let's just put burgers on the grill. Now that's their move that's their Innovation. They're doing. Now. We're gonna put Burger Grill.

We're gonna put grilled onions on there so that it doesn't taste more flavory because there's more flavor on there foreign. There's one plant-based thing that I definitely consume a lot of and it's the plant-based ground beef and it is honestly because I have found that it is better that it makes a Bolognese. That is obviously it's not going to be as rich and as satisfying as a as a meat-based bouillonaise. But it's going to be less heavy and it's easier. You don't have to worry about like separating the fat and stuff like it's easier to make a Bolognese and for like ground beef tacos the that plant-based meat like absorbs the taco kit. It absorbs that taco seasoning better even than beef does so I like those things because you know it's not much better for me and it's honestly not really that much more. ethically superior you know where they get the palm oil for the Beyond burgers and it's certainly not any better for anybody you know so. But it actually like is more enjoyable for those particular meals for me so that and that's where most people are with food. The moral imagination required to really deny ourselves the sensuous Pleasures that we have been reduced to 

That's It's a tall order. You know. It's a lot to ask and nothing at the same time you know It's the belief that there's something more and something greater that compels you to push. Beyond those things and that only comes from experience which you either have or you don't you know everybody should. Everybody needs to both at the same time give themselves a break and push themselves much harder. I know I have to do both of those things. But I think they do go together because one of the things that prevents us from pushing forward and asking anything of ourselves is the sense oh that we can't be forgiven. So what's the point but if if there's nothing that's unforgivable in the grandest scheme and I think that's true Then. There's no reason not to try to do what you know is right.

It's there it's buried. It's muddy. It's it's occluded but it's there hmm. Oh man. So many microplastics. We got so much microplastics. We went straight from lead to plastic. It's amazing as soon as we got the lead out we added plastic yeah. The Gen xers have gotten both wow they got the tail end of the of the of the look at the tail end of the um lead and then they got the front end of the plastic and then they've been just getting the plastic ever since damn yeah. I think the Gen X meltdown is going to be even more interesting than the than the Boomer meltdown has been because at this point the boomers are actually pretty old now and even though they're mostly like actually insane. They're also actually decrepit but the boomers are like their their Wick is is hitting the end and they are still relatively spry. Oh I love you too thank you fluid show yeah. I think of the human body as a as a I guess Battlefield is too judgmental as the rain a zone of interaction how about we put it that way between different Transcendent. threads things that go extend beyond like The Limited individual consciousnesses of the people that they infiltrate you've got of course the Great. the great microbes yeast and ergot you know you've got the different types of fungi that activate the dionysian and apollonian habits of mind and culture around wheat or mushrooms and they're in there battling it out moving around melanching you've got of course the the new Extrusion of of of plastic lead or they're all in there and we are just being pushed around by them as they interact and wind around one another and our and our history that we make is our largely unconscious propulsion through the system of interactions who up bioaccumulating Plastics. I think the safe answer is all of us. We're all doing that all right catch on the flap doodle.
