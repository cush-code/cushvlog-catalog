Come on get up get up get down with the sickness you. Get up come on get down with the sickness open up your heat and let it flow into me. I can see the sickness is rising and you see all that's good has died oh yeah. The world is a scary place come on you know it died get up come on get down with the sickness. You get up come on get down with the sickness open up your head and let it flow into me pop bow. Oh yes. It is a sick outfit thank you. I'm I'm looking fresh to death. It's what. I'm all about these days looking fresh to death and I'm doing it. I'm doing it my way all right yeah. I don't. I'm not on that. I'm out here. I'm out here. I'm out here trapping. So today we're going to be doing chapter 10 of the dawn of everything which is a pretty important chapter. I'd say it's it's it's. I think it's the longest so far and it's definitely one where a lot of the strands of their arguments are starting to really come together into a a Like a coherent thesis that the more I read about it honestly the less importance. It seems to have to me like i.

I find myself largely agreeing with what they're saying and and agreeing with how what they're saying is a challenge to an alternative to really the conventional narratives of of human civilization but the more I find it like get to this point. The more I kind of also think at the same time well who cares what difference does it make like they they're. The the underlying premise. Here is that this new understanding of human history has a political valence like all of the sort of squinting and wish casting and creative interpretation of evidence that they do. They do pretty exclusively pretty explicitly on the service of a political agenda and again. I don't have a problem with that I i I admire the the um the frankness of that because obviously everybody is doing that all the time it's just. We're always supposed to pretend and lie about the fact that that it's happening or and give them credit for being explicit with it but like the political valence of their argument to me seems totally frankly non-existent like if everything they say is true about how human civilizations evolve. I still don't know how it changes the price of butter you know how it has any influence on the question of politics in the here and now and I'll get into why but like just to start with that's what I'm kind of getting with as.

I'm reading this so just to summarize what's in the chapter which is why the state has no origin the humble beginnings of bureaucracy and politics. So this is where they're making a challenge to conventional evolutionary models for human civilization that say there's this thing called the state that has these features and which evolves basically alongside the complexity of human social organization people as soon as you get a certain number of people. The the old argument goes a state will come into being to manage them that that is what they are in this chapter most. That is the argument that they are trying to subvert and challenge and one of the first way they do that is pointing out.

This is a pretty kind of a no-brainer really nobody can seem to to agree on what the a state is. There are a bunch of different understandings and explanations for what what you have to have socially to have a state and if that's the case it makes you wonder well then what the hell is. It even is this thing if it has no stable definition if it's if the definition of it seems to be motivated by the underlying assumptions and and preferences again the political element of the person studying them so what they do is. They bake down civilization three things that exist in all modern states and that you might argue evolve at some point in human history somewhere but they're going to point out are not connected necessarily which is what state formation theory previously assumed and they are sovereignty that is monopoly of violence over territory ability to determine who lives and dies basically in modern modern in modern schmitty in terms of deciding the state of exception the other is and that is then that is associated with like. I said a monopoly on violence and the district and the the infliction of violence. Only me or people that I explicitly authorize can carry out violence that is a element of the state and that is a monopoly and a hoarding of violence.

The second one is administrative capability which is essentially a monopoly in a hoarding on information and the third is charismatic politics that is the ability to get people to do things just because you're that awesome you are able to demonstrate to them just how awesome you are and how you deserve to be listened to and given things. And those three things are all to be found in like a mature state and traditional models that they're once again. Challenging say these three things come into being not all at once but in a sequence and that's and and it's determined by once again complexity of administering a bunch of people so in in in the traditional model. Of this. The one that comes first is always administration. It is you got you got once you get x number of people and they're doing y amount of complex. Economic activity and and creating surpluses then you need to administer their actions and that that then becomes the the thing that generates charismatic politics as people you know justify or vie for positions within this administration which of course is gonna. You know be directing orders in in one direction and you know people are going to be situated along it and how do they do that absent. You know formal mechanisms that haven't been developed yet other than charismatic competitive politics and that once you have this strata of power over seeing this administrative apparatus boom you've got sovereignty because now you have charismatic leaders with control of administrative apparatuses who can use those apparatuses to monopolize violence.

This is not a fitted by the way it's got the classic thing in the back. I'm not. I'm not one of those. I don't even know my head size. I couldn't get up fitted and so what grab grow argue is that that is not some sort of fixed natural inexorable order. The the mesopotamian civilizations we've talked about. That had these relatively egalitarian structures of distribution in the cities right oh. I flipped I got this wrong no. I'm sorry what I'm describing is what happened in mesoamerica where you have this administration and then you have the emergence on the periphery of charismatic politicians who then take it over and use it to avoid sovereignty. The traditional definition is from administration to sovereignty and then finally a charismatic politics devised to ratify those two things together. But they're saying that mesoamerica is another model and that there's a model where you have charismatic like origin. Myths emerge from competition and then sovereignty adhering to those individuals and then those individuals using that sovereignty to order people essentially to create an administration. So the point is there's no fixed way.

There's a bunch of ways that these three strings three things can come together which means traditional notions of a conveyor belt of state formation are wrong and then to make this point. They pull up three examples of civilizations that emerged early in human history. Where one of these three elements of sovereignty are fixated upon and and and structures are built to reinforce without the other. Two and the first example is in mesoamerica where you have where you had the olmecs who were the progenitor civilization in mesoamerica before there were any aztecs or any inca or who whose civilization such that it has left. Its mark is a a is completely fixated on ritual competitive sport between aristocratic warriors. This ball game where you like hit a rubber ball with your hip and tried to get into a little little hoop. That was you know endemic among mesoamerican civilizations and that all that the aztecs also played but but all of their residual physical culture is fixed on displaying scenes of this comp competition and this is like this is an embodiment of a a social order.

You wouldn't call it a state but a social order organized around charismatic politics but which doesn't really feature any evidence of a meaningful administrative capacity. Besides the ability to administrate the war the the the wars and the sports that you know basically blend together or any real sovereignty extended beyond the territory of the ritual space. They call this a theater state where the implication is is that rather than being like a fixed structure. It is a temporary perhaps seasonal coming together where these games and sports are carried off and then everybody kind of goes back and does their own thing. The implication here is that a lot of the stuff that we see in ancient like physical remainders you know temple complexes and and art that points to people who are like you know state-brained towards the world of like total domination and like permanent structures of control could very well be a situation where the vast majority of people are either. Are either humoring to get just get a lot get along with or actively participating as enthusiastic spectators to a temporary expression of like aristocratic. Contests between warriors but one that does not actually deal that does not actually generate a capacity for sovereignty or administration that doesn't actually like rule over anybody not permanently.

So this is a state a state let or whatever where you see one of the three legs and not the other two another example. Then this is the most interesting one. I've never heard of this and obviously you as you can imagine and you'll figure out why in a second this is very interesting to me There is this complex in the peruvian andes called chavinda hunt. My handwriting is bad huantar.

I believe which is essentially which is in its physical remainders. What were what we found and looked at that was built and left is a society organized around tripping balls the artwork and the structures that were are left are these psychedelic depictions of forms not stabilized as they are in most ancient art where you have this is a tiger. This is a human and this is an eagle and they're cut in some sort of interaction with each other rather human and animal shapes that went in and out of each other if anyone if that feels familiar to anybody who's ever who's ever had a psychedelic experience and that like their temple complexes rather than being like a big big open place for people to witness. Some ritual are rather a network of a labyrinthine tunnels and chambers that people are led that presumably people would be led through in small numbers or and in some cases only through narrow hallways or narrow passageways that could only allow one person and that at the center of this one complex there's this. This carved and engraved stella. This this pediment that presumably someone would at the end of a psychedelic journey come to and then bear witness to and come out of that experience with some sort of knowledge that would then be I mean by definition esoterically held by people who had been initiated into the process. So here we see a civilization organized around the hoarding of knowledge that is the basic premise of administrative capacity but again no charismatic politics. There's no there's nothing indicating any individuals in any of this. Any of this art and no sovereignty of any kind extending beyond the immediate area where these rituals are carried out and 

I honestly think that if we really want to say how did we get stuck how did civilization get where it is where we got stuck in this out of instead of the shifting and protean movement of people that characterized early civilization and I gotta say at the end of the day. I'm preg as a neophyte. I'm relatively convinced at this point of the grab grow idea of early human social order not as people on different levels of a continuum but as a constantly shifting and pulsating ball until until you get to a point where all these societies they they like they encounter one another. They are changed by their encounter. They create stable stability and homeostasis within a certain situation. They come into encounter with each again they break up but they're never They're nothing is ever fixed and structured because more than anything the fact that people can move the fact that human the human civil. The human numbers relative to the size of the planet and its resources are such that all real conflicts can be resolved by moving by going somewhere else and and that that the intoxicating um the intoxicating malleability of of society that grab grow paint here can be maintained due to the malleability of the world. The literal environment we find ourselves in because there is not the same the stakes of resource conflict are different But then we got stuck they and they themselves describe it as being stuck and and you know once you get to dominant states. Then all of this stuff in my opinion goes out the window which is a big reason that I kind of wonder what the political utility of this is because you know it it. It wipes the it it becomes a process of that shoot that like flow that human flow that characterized like the global human community is is interrupted and reversed and eventually and it's it's a one-way ratchet of those those non- rationalized and dominated spaces being rationalized and dominated and where does it start.

I think it starts in those esoteric rituals that certain adepts find themselves engaging with in or in these societies for the necessary task of providing a religious narrative for the society which is inherent and necessary you want to talk about things that are not viable. That's one of them because to have a social order is to have a agreed. Upon. You can call it a narrative. You can call it a fantasy. You can call ideology whatever it is and it could be. It is to one degree spiritual and another. Secular no matter what it is both of those things and so there are there are always going to be people who are going to be better at telling stories. They're going to be people who are better at convincing a narrative. This goes back to the charisma thing like yes. The warriors are able to conquer by virtue of their physical prowess but that physical prowess is not necessarily go with an ability to narrate their actions and it's the narrative of the actions that actually keeps things stuck together that actually maintains social cohesion. It is not the act it is the remembering of the act and by definition the people who are going to do that narrative cannot be the people who actually did them they're going to be people who observed so I'm talking basically about the indoor kids the nerds they're always going to be there and they're going to be fundamental to the to the maintenance of any social structure as fundamental as the warrior class and everyone will know that and how do you main how do you keep telling these stories in a way that convinces everybody including and this is the important part you because this is not a self-conscious thing at this point there is no position of like radical skepticism of of phenomena. I mean yes but it cannot be expressed. It cannot be validated because the social body is too over determining. It is extinguished by the continual non-stop interaction towards the common goal of survival so you're convincing everybody including yourself and one thing that helps with that big time is psychedelics and maintaining your ability to narrate involves ritually encountering esoteric knowledge through the heightening of senses which is what psychedelics at the end of the day.

Do this is yes I mean people saying oh duality dualism yes. This is an imposed dualism. It is a lie agreed upon and I would argue that the thing that allows you to dominate your fellow man is when enough of that group of people in a social order encounter the esoteric knowledge of non-dualism. The thing that can't persist socially because we need dualism to evaluate our behav our environment and interact with it. Like on a moment-by-moment basis. We need to think in oppositions so we won't encounter non-dualism except in specific moments of contemplation reflection like the buddhist sitting underneath the damn banyan tree or if you're too busy for any of that psychedelics but psychedelics matched with a specific ritual because remember when we're talking about this chavin complex. It's not just blank walls right. Like these are images that have been agreed upon to be depicted to lead you in a certain direction and one of the things that can come from like the encounter with nonduality and then having your encounter with non-duality confirmed by others in an esoteric sect.

One of the things you can cut the r run of the realizations that can be come to especially. I would argue in conditions of crisis ecological or otherwise conflict with other humans and changing ecological conditions that the same lie that you all tell each other every day about there being some difference between you as a group and the world around you is going to have to be furthered by a new lie that there is some difference between us within the group because and we will rationalize it in our in our temples. It's the only way that we will able to be to be able to get people to respond to the crisis that we see in time because these wonderful deliberative processes that grape girl love to jack off about are inefficient and they would agree with that yes they're gloriously inefficient.

They're wondrously inefficient yes in times of fecundity. They are they are a luxury that can be afforded under certain conditions and when that luxury could no longer be afforded. The the amount of time you give to getting consensus has to be constrained and that means consensus has to be defined differently not everybody agreeing but most people agreeing and the rest giving up one way or the other out of some threat or browberry browbeating and then how and then the greater the crisis. The more that decision-making power has to be abrogated so he says efficiency is not valuable perfect. Yes because value is the the underlying premise of value is scarcity and the societies that grab grow are jacking off to are ones where scarcity has been effectively abrogated. Not all the time but out of the equations of like social life written out of. Our decision-making matrix value comes into it when consensus is can no longer be afforded so this society shove on.

Here is the is the ball stripping culture where you have a a a a surplus. Redistribution effort that goes into the creation of a alter that creates esoteric rather than public knowledge like the olmecs are doing huge public spectacle to overall and impress their their neighbors basically like grab girl could argue. We don't think of it so much as to overpower them. But rather to you know vent their need to be seen and to be valued and to be to be applauded and then they get it off their chest and then they can go back and to being like basically equal to everybody else outside of that time frame which is you know that's the that's the will the power that formulates that that drives people towards a political life. The opposite is the chauvin where all of the public art is designed to move the elect those who can perceive and re-express it towards esoteric knowledge that is perhaps taken and then brought with one back to one's community. Essentially a sacred college for the shaman or or wise men or narrators of the community to come here have this experience and then go back with this knowledge but like the way that the olmecs like what we're describing with the almex is that is essentially That is the military arm of the state embodied like the fundamental psychology of the military and then at shove on you have the psychology of 

The the bureaucrat. The bureaucratic state extending to and defined by really more than anything the academy right the cathedral if we're talking in mold buggy in terms. This is where we actually like structure our narrative for understanding the world which gives the army guys a mission and motivation to fight but which here's the important part. This administrative structure built around esoteric knowledge cannot be in charge of a real state. It needs a thing on top of it and that is sovereignty embodied at a single point that is the king and here we come to the last civilization the natchez in the lower mississippi gulf coast area in louisiana where all the surplus of the of the social structure is brought to being and creating this great village where the natchez son lives the god the king who has absolute sovereignty over everyone in his immediate vicinity.

He can take any wife he wants. He can kill anyone he wants. He can take any objects from anyone. He could violate every rule that they had every law because the law giver must be above the law. The lawbaver cannot be constrained by the law or else. He's not the giver of it. You have to be beyond good and evil to define good and evil and that is what the monarch that's what the sovereign is for but again here only sovereignty because outside of the great village where he doesn't leave. Nobody has to pay attention to the king nobody. Nobody takes his orders if they don't want to follow them and he has no administrative state to even tell anybody what to do. But you have this this unlimited sovereignty in an individual which of course is then attenuated by those other things. It's attenuated by having a military it's attenuated by having a administrative capacity but then in its person it is able to basically hide and mystify the hand of the academy because the reason you can't have the academy ruling directly. The bureaucratic class ruling directly is because while they might be totally unable to see the self-interest that motivates their actions because they're ideologized like the rest of us. They've they've chanted the important thing to understand here is they're not enchanting when they take power when they when they when they redirect social structures away from communal life they're not doing it. Cynically.

They're not doing it oh. I'm gonna trick these. They're doing it because they have collectively come to a realization about what they think is necessary to survive and then covered it with their faith in one another their their trust which comes from having a definition apart from everyone else. That is people who have the knowledge people who know that this is all fake that there is no world where there's no distinctions here. But we're still bodies with feelings and emotions and desires and needs who would rather not experience suffering. So we have to work together as though we were different in order to reduce suffering but that is a contradiction because now once we're separate fear takes over our relationship to the other. So this is all the stuff that goes into the subconscious transformation that occurs within like the the academic shamanic narrative storytelling narrative class but well their self-interest is invisible to them. It is nakedly clear to everybody else if you are not in this class and you are part of a rapidly solidifying order of hierarchy that you're at the bottom of and he's insisting to you that it's for the good and it's what god wants him stuck in his subjectivity doesn't recognize the vast chasm in experience between you know sitting around the fire and eating berries and whatever the agricultural labor being at one end of the spear or the other so that becomes like an x-ray machine shows the self-interest and creates alienation.

You can't have that you need an embodied sovereign standing in front of this this bureaucratic consensus and mystifying it with his person which stands outside of human interest which is not the true of the administrators. So here we have three societies each with a fixation around one of these three elements of sovereignty that doesn't contain any of the others and I think the best way to explain. That is this is society in flux. This is society that is seasonally and geographically unbound. This is a society where we might look back through history and see. These physical structures that were left behind and we might decide that they were the determining factors of the social order. But what was actually the case is that they are all temporary products of a temporary bringing. Together of people who might share a culture share a language but whose lives are largely spent responding to the cycles of nature and these things we have the the the olmec ritual game palaces and the chevoen ball tripping palaces and the natchez great village of of ultimate sovereignty and the great sun is you have different ways for different groups within a social order not by like rank or hierarchy but just affinity aesthetic affinity. Like the olmecs the jocks the chauvins the nerds and the natchez. The the beautiful somebody with some physical mental inherited distinction from the people around them. That is that these remains remnants are these groups coming together and the society in general creating a ritual to allow them to either facilitate their ability. The the skills facilitate to facilitate the sharpening of the skills that they need in their communities. So like the olmecs they really needed good warriors because it was a context of small states all fighting each other and shove on. It's you need the the shaman.

I don't know maybe because of the the ruggedness of the environment because rather than most civilizations that emerge in the lowlands. This one emerges in the in the treacherous andes and then in natchez. You have this this overpowering sovereignty probably because when everybody got together because of how far away they were and how little they interact with each other because of just how far they could wander in this incredible abundancy without hitting anybody else. When they get back together they can't stop fighting one another. They're they're not. They don't have a common experience enough to avoid conflict so you need a sovereign with sovereign power to in that moment when everyone's together keep everyone chilled out. This is this is all just me you know imagining but like that is the notion is that in this in this flow of human civilization this up and down this. This steady state a lava lamp of human social forms.

What we're looking at when we look at archaeological evidence is just the sedimentary remnant of places where certain groups who spent most of their time in control of their own lives. In all the ways that graber defined the the graduate defined like being able to make to make and change social relationships to be able to move away There's one other one whatever they're all there in in in abundance and that what we have is not a permanent structure of dominance that emerges as soon as people come together but rather the ornamental and the ornaments of the necessary structures that emerge in those moments of concentration to facilitate everybody living together and everybody living apart and again. I find this a very persuasive description of of the the reality of social change before the emergence of the of the real mature state and like part of the argument they make with this is they point out that there is this strong. There is a strong bias against dark ages and interregnums in the historical record when people are looking back on it because they don't leave all the pretty. They it's only in the high um the apogee of like dynastic oppression and expansion that you see these golden ages of material culture and when there's k when when there isn't that when you have like fewer remaining pieces of physical culture like beautiful masks and and and pots and all this stuff and the you have less of it and the stuff you do have is of is lower quality. It's more utilitarian maybe because that rece that surplus isn't being held in the cities and held in the in the temples. But it's being used in the day-to-day by people and that you have as complex a civilization you have as You have all the same structures of cooperation that you have in those periods of high dominance. But you don't have a physical record of them and so they become just these periods of anarchy and again.

I find that very very persuasive as an explanation of how this stuff how we get these narratives and and how they hide what really was going on and so in trying to get figure out how we get like more mature states. Out of this flow we go back to egypt where greg girl point out that the figure of the king and later the pharaoh in egyptian society. Stands above human human but does not display that charismatically there is no culture of competition among humans in ancient egyptian aristocracy. The pharaoh stood alone and unchallenged the only real public rituals. The pharaoh ever did were like a chariot race or chariot ride or something where they were the only person going all those contests had been settled by the gods in the heavens. So there's no charismatic culture but eventually you do see. This really intense. Administration emerge around the king in the form of caring for it. Because this is unchallenged. God king requires a lot of care and feeding. He becomes basically a little baby and that's why monarchy is like. The one of the only political structures that has any that has kids involved in any way because a baby could be a king. Maybe cannot be a ruler in any other social structure and that's because that sovereignty is in the is is in the person itself. It's not justified by acts the way it would be in a charismatic politics. It's it's fixed to the person and that means that the person has to essentially be treated like a god and that means fed and bathed and and pampered and that means the the employment of a bunch of people to do that which requires surplus to be given first to them and then to the to the king but then like the king can't die either because if it's if their body itself is embodied is imbued with godliness then then that has to persist beyond death if it doesn't then why are we doing any of this stuff. None of it will last there is no reason to suborn ourselves to this. Even ritually the ritual has no hold unless the king is preserved beyond death unless we wrap him up and hold him up and continue to feed and water him and grab row.

Here make a an argument that the real thing that led to the bureaucratic regime of agriculture extraction in egypt was feeding was getting food and drink beer and bread to dead kings because for some reason and it's amazing that greg grow don't even stop to ask hey. I wonder how this happened It was decided by who who do you. Think's decided this that the food and drink that the kings the dead kings consumed wasn't the same one that we mostly consumed the living. The living mostly consumed stuff that was accessible with relatively low effort low labor input foodstuffs they could make beer and they could make bread out of wheat but that was a higher amount of calories and put it that was a higher amount of labor required so they mostly didn't. They use this special occasion but the king only drinks beer the king only eats bread so now to feed and water. This. This dead guy to keep him eating pizza and budweiser you create a permanent structure of agricultural surplus extraction and again it's amazing they've laid out all of this how this happens and they don't stop they just stop. There. They say oh no see that's what caused it. It wasn't the agriculture that created the state. It was the other way around like once again. They're only making the narrow point that it was in flux well how about we try to determine some direction here who the hell is deciding what the goddamn god king eats or drinks. It's not the god king. It's the priests. It's the priestly class you don't think they recognize which types of food require what sort of social structures that then bequeath unto them administrative capacities and sovereign capacities. So we have is This sovereign god king who is now hearing sovereignty and I mean is it hearing even without like the the warrior culture he is able to assert authority through this regime of agriculture to to feed him. Now. This is unstable and collapses and I maybe you can understand you can see what the problem is. Here. The reason that the god that the the god king becomes immobile basically becomes not a warrior not someone who has to challenge his challenge and prove his power in the real world. Someone who is born with it is that it disempowers the warrior class you cannot claim power through force again who does this serve who is in the driver's seat now somebody's saying oh he's blaming it on the jews. See the jews get blamed for this because of their their position in europe and the fact that they were not allowed to engage in the largely engaged in like the the culture.

The agricultural value structure of europe and were forced to adhere to those middle strata. I mean they they got into the bourgeois basically because there was nowhere else to go. They were forced into it but they just that's just a happenstance of history. This is just a class taking power over time and that class being an administrative and bureaucratic class who is able to operate from a remove from other structures of power and therefore able to assert control other of them. Now what capitalism is is when this class takes power and then creates technology that takes it away from them because I would argue that capitalism is inevitable unless something else changes but I gotta argue no like you know cap if we're talking about like this in fluid dynamic terms. Capitalism is inevitable as soon as permanent regimes of state power become hegemonic as soon as they can no longer be challenged by other structures because one they will always beat the other structures because of their advantages in efficiency and two 

They are inherently like any other social structure in conflict with like the lived environment. But the problem is is that without any fluid social order to take the energy away to like take the venting take the refuse created by the contradictions. Within it it will crash the entire structure but the thing is people are making decisions right and at some point people are going but but they only make decisions by abstracting away responsibility and decision making to questions that can be answered empirically. What I mean is technology is built as like a wedge to facilitate administration overlying charismatic power and warrior power military power which is what the state is like if the state is these thief rings coming together the modern state as we understand it one that can win against any other competitive. Any other combination of these items is one where real power has been concentrated in the bureaucratic and executive but that requires a programming. It requires a cultural algorithm to power every interaction within it because these are people making decisions and they know that there's no right answer and so they have to at the end of the day flip a coin and that is the ritual of power and the answer to that riddle that the administrative state gives is a machine can flip a coin and so we've had a flowing a coin flipping our flip. We've had a machine flipping the coin ever since and because this state structure within with within a like.

A closed ecological loop continues to destroy itself and class conflict powers that destruction class conflict in conditions of a ecology that is still fluctuating. But it is now slapping against the whole of civilization rather than guiding it and the only way that power can be held in that instance in that phenomenon is if it is personalized is if we can wrench our spiritual conception of the self inward and away from anything else that we could recognize as human the way that we did with the stuff that we could recognize as as something deeper than the arbitrariness of humanity in in earlier times. And this is the thing that is unidirectional and that is a teleology whether grab girl want to admit it or not and that is once you have that shift once once there's that eternal cultural hegemon hegemonic ideology that defines the self differently than it used to there's no going back from that. There's only going a furthering of the process and capitalism is merely the uncloaked technological exoskeleton of that cultural programming that all mature states are not our. Engine are um that all mature states are powered by and over time it only gets worse. Our definition of this of of south becomes more inward-looking and technology is what asserts that technology is what makes that first physical separation and then first in in space like suburbanization and then in time in terms of yeah.

You're not any farther away from each other than they used to be spatially but. You now have a cyber realm that you can spend time in that is not an engagement with any other person but his mirror merely a mirror reflection of the self. All our time spent online reflects the self and redefines the self as separate and that is the technological arm of this. This algorithm that is deeper. I would argue than than capitalism and goes. Back. Farther capitalism is the social recognition of changing conditions just as feudalism was just as the slave empires were oh. Things are bad now how can we stay on top and then reconfiguring based on what is that what else allowed to maintain those two parameters people in charge staying in charge and adjusting to the new conditions created by the decline. The consumption of the world that cannot be they cannot be redeemed fast enough okay so they posit that mature pharonic power in egypt emerges because this baby king setup is unstable because things get worse. There's a drought people are starving the baby king can't do about it and it's bureaucracy can't do anything about it because it would mean them doing some work which they don't want to do so. It collapses but it does not collapse an anarchy and and and in a pejorative sense. It rather outbreaks in anarchy in in a positive grave growing sense and you go from the old kingdom to something that is referred to in the literature as the first intermediate period a dark age before the second.

 the the new kingdom or the what the regular kingdom. The middle one middle kingdom emerges but grabber says rather than some collapse into into chaos. That is then emerged out of sort of without anything having changed rather the formal like the power of the of the kingly sovereign class is reaffirmed because out of this collapse into petty principalities you emerge in a real charismatic heroic politics because people have to fight to live again. People have to fight to live in these declining conditions and in so doing some people are gonna fight better and by being able to fight better they're gonna and help others fight better and organize a victory and what victory means is plunder and what plunder means is people eat and that means this person now has a sovereignty invested in them. By virtue of their actions their heroic actions and so the new pharonic power that emerges has a base in that heroic era. But of course then it grows decadent as it becomes embodied in a inviable person over time and then conditions get worse and the legitimacy is destroyed and that's the cycle you get over and over again and it's a cycle that we're in now the difference. The only thing difference between this end stage crisis of the system we're in now and previous declines of empire is that there's nowhere else to go. We have run out of the the the flow in the globe because we've totalized capitalism that is totalized dominance predicated on resource extraction beyond what is sustainable beyond self-sufficiency piling up surplus to do violence with that is to waste it and eventually collapses because within itself it cannot reform.

Now. The marxist vision is that the specific technological reality of capitalism and how and and what all of that previous cyclical action had created as a physical culture of objects and knowledge i.e. Technology which was currently in the hands of the administrative sector of like western rulers but which could be taken by a working class that was living in the same increasingly living in the same conditions that had produced the bourgeois and their increased numbers would be enough to have them take power because if it's bourgeois versus workers and they have the same level of cultural sophistication access to technology and the same Like linguistic facility. All the same technological advantages of that had let the bourgeois rule from a position of minority if they had those same things plus the numbers plus all of these. Newly enlightened workers who had been pulled from the ignorance of of rural agricultural life that had let this thing go on for so long unchallenged from below really. I mean you'd have cyclical peasant uprisings but they could never really overthrow power. They could only redistribute it a little bit and then it would be reformed at the top because they're peasants. They're they're farmers. They did not have the technological capacity to confront the bourgeoisness or the rulers. Before them. The the feudal era aristocrats on their own terms. They needed to have access to the tactile technology and the marx's vision is the working. Class would be able to do that and they made a grab. They grabbed for the controls but it was a failure and now that means the terminal decline of an unchallengeable capitalist hegemony now of course that assume that makes you think oh no that just means the cycle is going to continue well maybe not if the world is completely destroyed.

But I honestly don't think that's going to happen. I think that is what we want to happen the same way. We wanted there to be a nuclear war to end all civilization during the cold war because that's the happy ending because we're not missing anything at the end of the day. That's what it is. We don't want to miss anything at least. I know that's kind of what power is my fear of light for of death and by because we're we're addicted like all right. Our egos are addicted to sense. They're addicted to pleasure pleasure of the senses and that is of course why we are all in a constant state of suffering because we can never have the thing the actual pleasure. We can only seek a idealized version of it a capital d desire that can never be fulfilled and if the world is a smoking crater then we didn't miss anything. That's why the ending of don't look up was such a terrible catastrophically bad idea if they really wanted to scare people about global warming because the vision of total annihilation is a rapturous one. It's why dr. Strangelove is a comedy so that means of course there's gonna be a lot of mystery horrible beyond anything we can say the slaughter to come as cameron. Diaz said in the counselor will be probably beyond our imagining because there is there is nothing crueler than a coward but the earth will endure probably even if there is a nuclear war as a part of like climate breakdown which is totally possible. I still don't think that ends life on earth. I mean think of it this way. People say oh if we get the six degrees of warming that's going to unlock the arctic permafrost we're going to turn to venus and that's the end there will never be anything else on earth or before we get to six degrees. Political strife on earth leads to a nuclear war.

That yeah probably kills all or most humans but also tamps down that that move towards six degrees and refrost that permafrost then so if that does happen. Then the thing that can be optimistic about is that if the if this cycle continues this thing of sentient beings coming into recognition of one another that is civilization comes that that process begins the wreckage of what we leave behind is going to be what they sift through to build it. And they will be different people than us because of that experience and it's essentially the same like the sucker of optimism comes from faith and faith in the faith in that which cannot be seen because um everything we see around us the structures of domination that run our lives and and the experience of living that we are compelled into makes us feel. Like you know life is misery and there's no point to it. But we're all still alive and we all value things that go beyond that sick desire cycle. And we don't have a name for any of them and they cannot be identified in the fossil record. Any more than the evidence of grab grows sort of egalitarian autonomous lifestyles are left and like the word love is an easy one to use to define this stuff. It's set it's sappy but it's real that's what art is art is. This is the remnant of that which cannot be formalized cannot be seen because what it is is. It is a feeling below the ability to replicate it which is the same experience. As seeing god.

You can have the experience and it will leave an emotional residue. But that residue as time goes away as time moves in one direction as entropy moves in one direction our ability to put any words to it goes away. Our our ability to communicate in any meaningful way goes away which is why esoteric knowledge of the kind that is hoarded by the shaman of the universe and helped bring about civilization. As we know it. Can be generated sort of with generated and maintained because you get somebody in an altered state show put them through a ritual and then in the immediate aftermath of that experience that can't be named can only be felt and is felt as this oneness. This this peace this serenity this absolute and this is the important part absolute certainty which is something that none of us can have in our moment-to-moment life and certainly can never express in any sort of language and I think depression. One of the big reasons that we're all depressed as a culture is how few opportunities to have those feelings we have and so that means all we have is our uncertainty and uncertainty breeds fear and misery and desire and suffering and all that. But there are you can feel ultimate certainty and of course. That's what religious fanatics and psychopaths go out and seek and they destroy the world and seeking it. They never find it if they found it. They wouldn't be doing that but it's that seeking of it that powers their actions and we're all seeking it in in self-destructive ways because you can't seek it formally without violating our laws of reality like our understanding of reality as as monads as unconnected beings bouncing off one another in an in a totally chaotic random s stew of matter.

Like yeah you have no faith without doubt but the certainty still lives underneath it as a memory but not as something that can be expressed to others. The closest we have are the symbols of religion and mythology or an attempt to evoke in us the memory of the feeling and the more successful. They are at doing that the more effective they are as as cultural technology but in a class society. We have these symbols that are meant to evoke these feelings and to some extent. They still do but to put to the service of a system that alienates us and makes us miserable and pulls us away from that feeling of certainty. And it's that fundamental schizophrenia that defines life under capitalism yes but only because capitalism is the faster and more technologically advanced and more ecumenically experienced than previous ones. There are more people on earth and more of them are experiencing life that way but it's a schizophrenia at the heart of power throughout history and it. But it's have felt within the power power those with power and those without because these symbols are to evoke this feeling and yet our lives are determined by structures that that insist that that feeling is the lie that that certainty of what unity that certainty of unity is a lie. It's not sustainable. It can only sustain itself as long as surplus can be extracted to lubricate its creaky wheels to keep the friction to a minimum and as soon as the lube runs out the thing starts falling apart.

The roman empire was the first version of this that really dominated the geographic area that would be most amenable to technological innovations because of its competitive state framework. But this is why I ultimately don't really see the how why this book is supposed to be blowing everyone's mind politically because as I said they are correct. There once was a churning sea of human social forms moving in and out of existence with the tides with with the tides of history and with the random randomness of event but that flow is interrupted by a fixed regime of power dominating first one geographical area and then extending outward and then history is these things popping into being like tumors in a liver and then growing like the malignancies that they are. It's a very fun book. I'm having a lot of fun with it and I'm glad. I'm actually glad for all the cool information like I really this has helped me think about history significantly like this stuff about like you know the global flow. That's really useful but as a political thing which they're trying to emphasize.

I don't get it. They're trying they're saying you can live collectively with all of the cultural stuff. All the things we think of as necessary for us for a real. Like meaningful civilization. The things that make us reflect on our oneness but allow us to enjoy our separateness. This is basically what he's hoping for and what marx was seeking to create on earth and what is the end point of all human civilizations.

The or the the imagined endpoint regardless of what they're actually creating a situation where yes there is enough freedom to allow us to live not in fear of one another and enjoy the separateness of each other enjoy our variance enjoy. The randomness that our temporary appearance gives us but to recognize that we are not separate but different faces of one another that is to live without fear that is to live without doubt and grab girl are arguing that you can have that of course not perfect people are not going to feel that way all the time there's miseries of life life is suffering and pain but there's going to be a baseline that maintains a homeostasis that minimizes things like gender violence. Warfare ritual sacrifice and class conflict born out of alienation because there will not be that fundamental schizophrenic break between the symbols as we are to observe them as they are propagated by those in power and as it is and what it is like to live under them. But once these tumors start popping up because of changing ecological conditions and people responding to them at different points until somebody responds to them in a way that gives them a competitive advantage because it reduces a degree of inefficiency that allows for decisions to be made quicker for for social alienation to be directed inward or directed outward and pointed at an enemy as opposed to staying inward and undermining from the social body and then it starts gobbling up all those egalitarian areas behind besides them. Like they've described several times how in mesopotamia you had this relatively egalitarian settled urban culture in ur and then on the peripheries of its trade network. These heroic kingdoms people who basically were like this stuff is gay like I'm a big strong guy. I don't want to have to listen to these people and do what they want to do.

I want to go out and kill people. I got a lot of testosterone flowing and I could and if I fight I know I'll win or at least. I have a strong belief that I'll win unlike the nerds in there or like no. I don't want to fight. I might die and they go out of the periphery and they create these warrior cultures that under conditions of ecological flux allow force to be de employed in a way that decapitates these egalitarian cities and takes them over from outside and that does seem to be what happened in mesopotamia. You have like they've talked about how like the the the the council structure that they'd had before the king showed up persisted after the kings took over and the the day-to-day life of urkians. Of was not that much distributed disrupted by having a king but of course over time that changed and that power wrenched downward throughout the social order. As stresses accumulated as other empires emerged that copied them in order to fight with them.

So they have a thing in here where they describe how bureaucracy actually emerged not to facilitate domination but to actually facilitate egalitarian distribution of resources. A little village in syria where 6200 bc a fire happened that that fixed this community. This clay structures and baked them and we have what do we got what do. We know we got a little village equal sized houses and a central store room and a symbolic a collection of like symbolic tokens used to keep track of distribution of resources. So this is and no king no power so boom. We got bureaucracy to facilitate egalitarianism. Similarly There's a system in inc. In peru the ilu system of distribution of resources in a community to make sure that everybody has land and that nobody gets too much power no too much money where it's all debts that are accumulated over a period of time. The technology like these knotted bits of string that were used to count and and record keep. We're all like loosened out at the end of the year in order to keep everybody square which is sometimes associated with the incan kings but which preceded them and was then taken by those kings just as in mesopotamia.

Those bureaucratic structures are now taken over to impose equality as in we're all equal as subject. We're all equally subject to the king but with the demands that that comes with being equalized as well. Like look the king demands x from everybody. You're all the same but of course everybody isn't the same and what those systems like the ioul system would do is recognize difference.

Oh this guy's got a bro broken leg. He can't bring me as much he can't produce as much crops. You know there's someone sick here okay so we have to redistribute the labor and we will redistribute it collectively so nobody feels like they've been forced to do anything. Now the king comes in and says no you all need to give us x because you're equal well. Some people aren't going to be able to and now we have the new class of slaves. We have the new peons we have the new concubines we have the people who can be subject to violence who are written out of the contract because we've imposed equality through bureaucracy but one designed to dominate and it's like once again.

I think that's a very elegant structure that is persuasive to me as to how that happens but again it pretty. Much always. Happens in that direction over time is that the warrior caste society that is able to create an aristocracy of physically powerful and militarily skilled warriors who work perhaps with a priestly class but who over awe and dominate the priestly class because even the priests think that these guys are gods because of their power because of how awesome they are and what they've seen them do what they've seen them do. They're going to be able to exercise violence much more effectively than your. Little community garden co-ops and then they decapitate you and. They take over and eventually use all of your structures to their ends. So this is we get to the end of the chapter and they they conclude.

States emerge not out of inevitable processes of evolution but through happenstance and that play kingdoms become real ritual structures that are meant to be temporary get elongated into permanence. But the civilization pre-exists states and they end with a description of minoan crete which very well might have had a theocratic form of government where like priestesses female priestesses ruled over men like the island in the nic cage version of wicker man and they basic. They use this just to point out that even though you have all this physical evidence that yeah they had some sort of democratic like witches coven running over them Nobody in archaeology will call it that because they just have refused to believe it could exist well look you imagine how much that the regime of discrimination like refusal to say take evidence at face value the applic. The application of like a rigor a rigor that would never exist that they would never extend to anything that affirmed their beliefs imagine how that shapes all of our understanding of history and it's like yes correct once again. I think they've made their their argument very persuasively and at this level I'm. I'm ready to say it makes sense to me. So I'm going to believe it because that's all I can end up going with but again my big takeaway is that they make no argument yet. There's one chapter in the conclusion left that a four like anarchism in the now and here and horizontalism in the now and here that um that deals with my central problem which is what we've shown pretty conclusively in this book is that the inefficiency which is a virtue the social virtue. If you want to keep something stable and long lasting in isolation that inefficiency of decision making is a virtue. It allows you to have bureaucracy and and it allows you to have a priest warrior classes and allows you to have sovereigns and and without feeling. Like you're being exploited. It allows you to do that but again that's only in a stable state. The stable state is not possible in the in a condition where humans are coming into contact with each other and recognizing strangers and not friends which the definition of all interactions between humans. Once you get past a certain degree of human of a certain level of human civil human population not within a group which is what they do a good job of undermining but collectively how many people there are on the earth and eventually they start bouncing into each other and bumping into each other and once they do. They're going to adapt to that reality where they can't go somewhere else and maintain their level of inefficiency of structures where they have to stand and if they have to stand then they have to change their structures and what's going to have to go is all of this glorious inefficiency. All these areas for consensus and and response to the land and each other recognition. It has to be hierarchicalized now the the marxist teleological dream. The culmination of like the human experience that we're all yearning for is for the regime of technological administration that we have developed that is absolutely capable of of providing for everyone on earth not in equal conditions but in conditions of minimal alienation. This is what I mean not equal conditions and they would agree. Equality is means nothing really if you don't have a basic buy-in to the social structure. You're part of we have we we could turn this it might be too late now. I mean it is too late now with what we have but like during the 20th century when there were still hinge points of real contingency in the battle between the working class and bourgeois that characterized the 20th century. If things had broken a little different and and here's another part of the thing that makes me optimistic fundamentally in another world. They did in another version of earth. They absolutely did a version of earth that is as real as ours.

They did that where the feelings and the blood and the and the sweat and the toil and and the grandeur and the the aesthetic heights and and the all of the the beautiful like marbled experiences that every all the billions of people on this planet have felt have been felt there too that the working class directing this administrative alienated technological state can create could take that technology and put it to the work of creating a unequal and the thing is. It wouldn't stay unequal right like. It's not like oh you're telling me that all the people in africa who live in like absolute poverty are going to just stay in absolute poverty but be happy about it now no because there will be a project of alleviating that property alleviating that problem that poverty will be a collective goal accepted by every structure of human civilization and move towards which means surplus being moved from one part of the structure to another from one geographic area to another but those people in the middle not being dispossessed not feeling like they're losing anything because without the need to affirm hierarchy through surplus the but still this is crucial able to enjoy difference but do it ritually enjoy difference ritually and also in the performance of a act a heroic collective act of pulling people out of misery and poverty and then once you get there. What's next there's a reason that the soviets set the terms of competition between the united states and the soviet union. On space exploration. We would never have gone to the moon without the soviets we might be going there now but only as a last-gasp effort to find value somewhere else and perpetuate human civilization as it becomes untenable on earth. We went to the soviets because the soviets understood like once you've created a a peaceful Once you have created a social order that allows everyone to work in one in one towards one goal using the technology that the concentration of capitalism has allowed to to be burst into being all that misery. All that human misery created these things that can then be used. Now that was the marx's vision. I would argue that that's also the anarchist vision because like even when they say there's no authority it's like well. They still what it's a bunch of collectives but those collectives make decisions and they're making decisions with by definition. This like increased technological capacity that is being used towards the social end of pacifying violence between people so that means even your anarchist communal. Horizontalism would bring about this condition of a general level of minimal sustenance safety certainty of safety you go to the stars you can literally go to the conquer not conquer but explore and touch and reflect on oneself throughout the galaxy and we basically forced the united the we. The the soviets basically forced the united states to create some sort of vision for for interstellar travel that like there's a reason that all those like america buffers like tom hanks fixate on the space program because it was our it was our best vision but of course in america. It was a crime to do that whitey's on the moon to do that to go to the moon when you have so much misery in your own country makes that country look like a joke and and sadism to everyone within it going to the moon.

Then when there isn't anybody who feels that way again not that they might not be suffering of course. They're suffering everyone's suffering but they don't attribute their suffering to the state. They don't attribute their suffering to society. They're able to deal with it on its own terms because they are not alienated from it again. Some people are there's always misfits. There are always outcasts there's always people who can't function but instead of now where the misfits and outcasts are people who literally want to feel. It'll be people who like were traumatized individually and like were the product of legacies of trauma that are still going to echo into the future even if we ever got to that level of social sophistication and they could be dealt with on that level. That is the horizon of like prison abolition is that people who are misfits can be identified as such and brought back in and those who don't can't be reconciled are such a small fat percentage of the population that you don't need permanent structures of domination to keep them away or to scare people away from being them. So this is the universal horizon. It's the only reason we can have. It's horizon. We're not gonna get now without a collapse in which we probably is here like. I mean like this could literally be a project of the squids in a hundred thousand years. Whatever whoever does it that is that is the geist coming into full recognition of itself and what it requires is the awareness and recognition that any structure of power that the liberatory collection of people most of them by definition workers but not all could put together would by definition have to have structures of efficiency of action equal to the forces that they would come into conflict with because if they don't they will be defeated which is why every great historical anarchist fable ends in destruction. Be it. Be it anarchist catalonia or nestor monko's ukraine. They all get stomped so that is why I think this is both a great book but from the point of view of what the authors wanted a failure because at the end of the day they cannot really as anarchists really ground their analysis materially. Every time they try to you can see them in the book. Doing this they start resisting because you icky materialism you're going to start telling me that I'm not a free being you're going to start telling me that I might just my actions have been predetermined by material factors gross icky. No thank you instead of moving through that working through that liberal frankly juvenile objection and then coming out the other end of it like go through the tunnel and come to the to the the pillar and do not be afraid. But no you got to run away from it. You know you're saying. I'm not a free being no materialism for me so that means like when they're talking about you know they're they're they're glorying in the in a the glorious the their glory and the inefficiency and the freedom of these structures. They never consider what allows that to persist materially they just take it for granted and what they do not recognize is that a social structure that can make decisions through administrative structures that depend on unquestioned hierarchy as opposed to having to establish legitimacy anew. Every time. An order is placed can do things in a way that allows them to harness the technological weapons of society and then direct them towards the domination of others with all of the misery that it is caused internally facilitating it by being directed outward. I mean it's it's astounding. It's an astounding machine and there's a reason that it won. There's a reason it took over and there's a reason the only thing they could defeat. It is a self-conscious state structure.

Not necessarily any of the states we have now like the united states lol no but in terms of something that has all three of those things that he talked about but where instead of being concentrated in a sovereign that is above us a sovereign that is within us and that can only be facilitated that feeling of a sovereign that is within us and is us but is also separate from us that's only possible through humans going through a a process of alienation from the world that becomes terminal which is where we are now. We are terminally alienated for the world around us. We are terminally selfish in a way that is not stable the only next step. The only thing after that is either complete annihilation as I said possible but enough but not inevitable and not likely honestly or the final realization of that neurotic separateness which is a re-fixation a re-enlargement a a a a spiritual big bang that reinscribes us as part of a collective and that allows us to participate in hierarchical structures without being dominated by them able to utilize bureaucracy and administrative administration and and exploit separation of labor at least temporarily until the degree of technology is sufficient that the amount of labor doesn't have to really suck star trek future see like under capitalism if you're this is one reason people can't imagine what socialism would really look like like post-scarcity socialism because under capitalism yeah if you don't have anything to do you go crazy. If you don't have a job that is productive in some way. It turns your brain into mush because you're not engaged in anything meaningful because you can't make meaning and as an ideologized subject of capitalism. That's what you want but in post-scarcity communism. That idleness is where we work where we work and of course that's something that probably will never happen. That's once again a fantasy horizon that keeps you on the treadmill. But what will exist is a place where the the actual pain the actual alienation of of carrying out a like a divided labor although the labor division should be minimized as much as possible where they have to exist minimize in such a way that that it's absorbable by the social fabric around it which is not what we have now all everything every alienation is shooting outward into into misery that we feel that we then express to the people around us and it dissolves the social. Foundations from within I mean we're in the middle of that right. Now we can see that all around us and yet we're we're part of it and then we're also seeing it and revolted by it and the more revolted by it. The more we we engage in it. It's it's a it's a doom cycle but like for example say there's no technology that's going to make it so that somebody doesn't have to You know go into a sub to the sewers and like fix something or you know deal with. Deal with gross stuff have to do something like with your body that is painful or Unpleasant somebody could do that job but somebody could do that job for like two hours a week as opposed to being compensated in money. They can then use to buy things that come at the expense of others and that just drowned the misery and by expanding it. You just do anything you want which will be constructive by definition it'll be constructive in one way or another. It will be it'll be constituted.

It'll be constitutive of human of social life and therefore will be positive and some of it is going to be. Astrophysics because people are still going to want to answer those questions and they're still going to have the capacity to do it. They're going to have more technological access than ever to try to pursue those questions. Everything that we do now that is productive like meaningfully socially productive will still be carried out because the desire to express that feeling of connection love to each other is still going to exist. But some people are going to want to express that love by finding out if there's other species in the universe or if you can you know see god and if you've conquered matter you can do that until everything possible that could happen has and every version of redemption and rapture and and revival that any of any human symbolic order has ever believed in can be can happen so yeah we'll all we're all going to rise again. We're all going to meet each other in the great by and by and knowing that makes it a lot easier to deal with the the real misery of of living in the black iron prison that we are in so yeah. I gotta say yeah grab grow valiant effort and I think they really do believe that they're dismantling marxism in some way with this or providing an alternative non-marxist egalitarian. Social history to rival the marxist one but sorry swinging a miss because it because it cannot be materialist. It cannot be truly metaphysical and it cannot really reckon with the alchemical transformation that goes on when a society breaks into classes and creates rituals around the perpetuation of them and then it makes a new type of person. I've talked about this with this book before and that you can't go back. You can only move through and that means that you have to grapple with the the institutional and technological consequences of those transformations well I know they. I know anthropology has a non-marxist class analysis. But it's it's academic. This they want to make this into like a popular alternative to marxism and look how big it is and they're talking about apparently like before he died. Greg was talking to grab girl about about to waingrow wayne grow he that would be funny if this was greber and wayne grow the guy from heat um yeah about this kevin. It's a grave girl but they want like they were gonna do like a whole series with this. Like that it was gonna be like this a debt like some other books and they were trying to do like an alternative to capital based on anthropology here. But while I think it does provide a real moving and plausible. Analysis of that of what human society looked like before reaching a a population threshold and this is the important thing grab girl are trying to take that on it's supposed to say no. It's not a function of population and I think what they're doing with the book and they're doing a good job of it is saying yes not within population of a given group but once you get enough people so that they're bumping into each other as strangers.

It creates pressures on these forms that push them and extrude them in one direction and that we've been living in the consequence of that ever since okay. So there we go that's chapter 10 next week. We're wrapping up here. This is the last formal chapter is chapter 11. Ha ends on chapter 11. How many chapters does debt have because if it's 11 that'd be pretty funny on the historical foundations of the indigenous critique oh. I'm sorry it's full circle. So we're gonna go back to the indigenous critique of civilization that began the book and and and finish breaking up their monument to the beauty the ecstatic wonder of of matriarchal consensus society that has 12 chapters oh man swing and a miss and then there's a conclusion. I think I'll probably do the conclusion because you know to wrap the whole thing up will be nice with its own episode. So two more of these and then maybe like after that. I'll do like a q a or something before we figure out the next book if anyone has any suggestions please let me know because I'm gonna need another one. After this all right talk to you guys later bye.
