Actually are we on are we on are we on oh. Here we go watch a weird ad about. Oh yeah you should you tweet about this. I gotta get my. It's not on my phone anymore alright. We'll just hang out hello. I'm here what up just holding the space. I'm holding the space until um matt returns okay excellent oh yeah you can monitor a chat on the thing. Are we online. I can't quite tell you gotta wait yeah you know if streaming just chatting. I didn't even like to turn on a stream caption for this that's okay whatever let's see hey guys sorry that there we are. There we are hey what up what we got a new setup. Here. Yes uh matt and I i came over to talk some business with matt and I figured that I would just bring some of my  and do a little duo's stream. We we are preparing. We are we're doing some some uh some testing out because as I've said on the street before I'm hoping to transition to sort of a multi-hour you know maybe three times a week stream at the office with me and chris yes where we can like trade things off and it's not me just staring at the at the chat and trying to like juggle everything. I will be. I will be the raz to max frasier exactly and gaming and gaming and gaming will be a big part of it that I'm very excited about because I do ever so much enjoy and I'm intrigued by all of the map-based games that chris and virgil both love. But I the thought of trying to play one and certainly trying to play one while talking to a stream gives me an actual headache. So uh the idea of being able to like just watch somebody play and talk about it. It's very appealing to me and we're uh in the backyard here doing a little beta testing. Yes. I'm um uh. I'm going to make matt watch me play.

Civ. 6 extremely badly. I've been playing civ for about uh two years now and I'd say I understand about uh 40 of the mechanics in that game. So I generally just uh uh throw  around and see what works but um. I don't know look forward to um to matt yelling about the governing policies of eleanor of aquitaine. I will be. I will be hooting and hollering about the ottoman empire. The ottomans not a playable civ institute can't even play the ottomans if there's anybody in the chat who can make a ottoman's mod for civ six please. Let me know all right because it's it's it's it's by your country right. I can barely hear let's see if I can turn  up. It's my country right yeah yeah oh. It's by civilization well how it all right is civilization so all right so is there like an arab uh. Yes civilization is that it yes uh what do they what is. That is that saladin yeah salad okay yes wow that must piss off the turks. It's like their guy because yeah saladin was kurdish if anyone was uh not aware of that. Uh how's the uh how's the audio. I just. I have my mobile audio setup going so. I'm not sure how it uh how it goes uh yeah. See someone wants us to play europa universalis which intrigues me because it seems incredibly complicated and is like like an early modern era thing and it's got all those those empires I love you got your ottomans your safavids. I actually kind of wanted to just do a game where I try to see if the safavids could roll over the ottomans and take over all of europe because I kind of have a weird theory that they could have done it because they were so damn uh. They they like had a fire in their belly. By the time they started like rising and confronting the ottomans that the ottomans just didn't have and uh you know if they could have rolled over anatolia maybe they could have well that's putting through the about the bulk and cap islamic expansion into uh into europe well that's the thing that I think will uh enrage you. The most about these things is how the mechanics of it being an actual game make it difficult to emulate actual history well.

That's fun I guess you can do your own thing um but yeah I i um I personally ordered a gaming pc recently and I'm gonna set it up at home. And I think that's gonna give me a better handle on uh streaming the mechanics of pc. Uh craft and being able to use the office one better because felix just ordered all the parts for the office pc. And then I tried to put together and had no idea what the  you the lacuna we've talked about this uh I i do find it amusing. I don't know a little bit about and that like canada is a soup oh. Yes canada is a sale canada. Let me get. This straight canada is a civilization but the ottomans are not. Canada is not a civilization. Canada is an appendix of the english of the english of the british empire wait is canada more an appendix of the british or the u.s. At this point well. I mean we what do you say after world war. Ii we took over and so they became our appendix. Either way. They are an extrusion. They are not in a civilization of their own right. All right. Then let's do this because I was just asking you this. We were talking about the american presidency as a general concept uh and how stupid it is and how funny. It is that joe biden might probably be the next one or perhaps the last one. What point do you think the american president became as an institution the most powerful person in the world. Uh I think what you said uh when we dropped a nuclear bomb. I think that's that's a very good adbc moment right. There. It gave us a a world destroying capability that no other country possessed at a various years at the moment that we were in the process of taking over the supervision of the global. Uh empire that the the battered european democracies were in the process of not being able to afford any more yes okay one second.

I think the audio is accidentally the laptop mic. This is not drawing power. Hi. Hey better is that better. I figured it out oh. We were doing it from the laptop yeah that was stupid. I have my. I have my little bear with us folks. I have my little audio boy. He brought this over in a backpack and you just threw it on there. It's this is not. There we go okay good. It just went. It wasn't lighting up at all. I was  up. I was seeing green lights trust the other thing when you got when you got the red. You got the green light going. It's very hard to talk and figure out. What's happening which is why having someone here is very nice. There we go much better thank you for complaining in the chat because when they complain to me. I just freaked out. I remember one time. I just quit a trap because they kept telling me. I didn't sound good and I didn't know what to do that was before. I bought my mic. I love. I love doing av yeah but now that I have my mic. I'm unstoppable if they say. I can't hear you. I'm like you're lying. I know. I know you can hear me because I bought a little elaborate lap mic. It's cool laptop um all right. I'm still going people said it was better now. Some people are saying it's lighting. This happens to me all the  time people yeah because they're gaslighting save. Let's see is that better am. I doing this right is that better I should have these mics going there. There yes yes now okay yes. There we go okay great. I just didn't have the driver turned on in the program okay. They're all very exciting okay. There we go fine. I was gonna grab again a tiny megaphone and holler into the microphone again. I threw all this  in my backpack and just walked over here. Exactly. Yeah give us a break okay great. Uh this is incredible thank you okay cool fine uh so now. The real stream begins after our first like 15 minutes of jacking off oh my god. This is giving me flat as I'm saying let's give me flashbacks to before. I got my lap mic yeah um. I'm glad that we were able to uh to get  break.

I'm trying to think of like what would count as a civilization in the western hemisphere. Given me you know that it's like. It's all settler colonialism. Sure it's basically at this point. It's basically all the same things it's not like. It's not part of an american hegemony. There's like three civilizations in the western world yes and yeah yeah. That's okay who's who are the civilizations in the western hemisphere. It's like anglo america is like one canada canada in the us and like all that's that's angles here australia as well. The five eyes yes yeah yes us australia new zealand canada and the uk that's one civilization one big thing. Uh ireland kind of although you can't tell them that because they'll get pissed because they don't want to think they're part of the anglosphere. I'm sorry it worked none of you speak irish. I'm sorry they teach did you know that they teach it in school good keep going but none of them learn it. No one speaks it uh any irish people can attest to this none of them speak irish even though they learn it all the way through elementary school and probably into into later school too. I wish. I had taken irish as a second language in uh like college or something. That's an obnoxious pick that's such an obnoxious. I took german in college just because I did too. I took like. I took like six years of spanish in middle to high school and then when I took the placement test in college. I got spanish one because I sucked  it. I took german my entire high school career and college didn't learn any of it have no retention of it. At all does.

Tragic tragus leaked projector the overhead light projector and I'm kind of glad because I i have a weird theory that people have told me is crazy but that doesn't stop me from believing it that like if I was a native german speaker or even a fluent one. I would be an insane person because I really do think that there that that language there's a reason that like heigl and marx and  like all spoke german is because it lends itself to a certain insanity it well. It's it's a it. It allows you to live in a symbolic realm yeah. Whereas english with the most words of any language is inherently earthy and bound because you're describing things you know in very discreet detail as opposed to like seeing the world and then turning it into like six twelve uh syllable concepts well that yeah. I like that description of english because it's like all of english language is just like going to a place being like what do they call that thing around here okay we called that yeah the best the funniest example of that is kangaroo. You know the story of kangaroo. I don't know the story kangaroo. Uh uh this might be a hocker pull. I'm not a linguist but the the the apocryphal story about people can confirm. This is a kangaroo essentially in in a in one of the uh one of the aboriginal dialects uh means i. I don't know what you're saying because the story is that some brits asked someone what are the originals. What are those things they say kangaroo and they're like oh yeah okay. That's what they're called. But they were really just saying. I don't know.


I don't know what are you talking about dude yeah no and yeah like. I don't think it's a coincidence that hitler was german you know what I mean. I mean there. There's like the daniel hold up. The daniel goldhagen thesis does not hold you know who the kings of anti-semitism were in. In modern europe it was not germany. It was france. France invented modern anti-semitism yes but germany is the one who ended up doing the holocaust and part of it is because they lost world war ii in france. Quote-unquote won it that's a big part but that language man. I don't know it's scary. Uh there we go apparently. It's not real but the kangaroo thing is real. I knew. It wasn't real. It's too good. It's too good of a story. There are a few good stories that are actually true though like this like the invention of the sandwich so that the earl sandwich could hold his meal while playing cards that's right true that is not made up. I just the only thing that makes no sense about that is that it would take until like we had recorded history to discover the sandwich. It seems so obvious you would think yeah.

You would think there's a lot of things though that were obvious that don't ever a birth like they never figured out the wheel in uh. Like pre-columbian america. You know they didn't have the wheel what. I don't. I just it doesn't matter exactly because you look at the wheel you're like duh. But there are specific things that have to happen to get you to a wheel that they didn't have the wheel one of the early technologies that you research uh in civilization mm-hmm you have to research it which I guess is fairly accurate. You have to think of this guy sit down and you got to think of the wheel does it just pop outside because now we are all like you need wheels. But if there aren't wheels you have to have someone be like all right. I'm sitting down and figuring out this until I actually get it and you know what helps that is uh. Is you know something like uh having uh.

I don't know uh horses yes that helps which western civilizations uh. The western hemisphere does not have yes no horses no matter what the book of mormon might tell you. There are no horses in pre-columbian america which is very funny because like when the when when the horses did show up. The sioux used them to basically take over the entire like uh planes almost overnight they like turned into the mongols they're like oh. This is great and they just were they took over everything yeah. As soon as the horses showed up. They didn't have any before that so they couldn't do it horses. Great technology incredible incredibly important s-tier technology for uh human civilization. So like you got no horses in west in the western hemisphere and then in poor africa.

They have zebras instead which are untameable which are untapable. Psychopaths more zookeepers die yep from zebra. Any other animal zoo zebras are the deadliest zoo animal. Uh that's really funny there's a thing in gun germans. They look. They look so sweet. I want to go up and just feed one in the little apple. There's a little bit and gunshots to seal when jared diamond imagines like what if africa had been able to turn the rhinoceros into like a war animal like in black panther yeah. Like exactly like in real life they would have they would have wrecked everybody but you can't do it. You you have to go to war. You have to go to with the resign of rhinoceroses and the water buffalo and the horses and the zebras that you have uh is guns germs and steel good.

Where are we on that guy. Everyone hates it because like any of those histories it's very facile and it skips a lot of things. But I think it's useful for people just to get an idea in their head that civilizations and  happen not because of people's desires you know not because people had an idea and wanted to carry it out. But because they are dealing with a given physical reality material conditions in terms of animals fluoride fauna that they have to confront and that is what shapes things the specifics of it can be argued all day. But I think that approach is more useful than anything because seeing  like ben shapiro talking about the two cities. Yes makes me just want to blow my goddamn brains out because it's like the idea that it's just ah forget forget forget. The conditions you know forget the constraints of the material world. I live in. I've got an idea where the  did the idea come from and his idea is god gave it to me. It's like okay. This is just schizophrenia. You're just you're just trying to turn schizophrenia into a description like an ex description for huma uh historical process. Every uh every uh historical figure in ben shapiro's world is like henry darger. He's just given like an idea and scribbling individual people just sitting there like looking at a  like uh a sunset until they have an idea ah democracy and then they go and carry it out. They convince other people to do it yeah. It's it's the liberal. I was saying this yesterday. It is the liberal conception of the self that we have some sort of inherent thing that is responding to the world and then that response creates a new idea that we then use to like wrangle with the world yeah. No we're empty. We are empty. We are hollow uh speaking of that.


I was reading about the voyages of christopher columbus the other day uh because I needed something to put me to sleep while from wikipedia uh and that that is all those things. It's like. Why did he do that. Not because he was a genius. But because they needed the spices to sell them. We need a better route to the spices because the ottomans shut it off the ottomans shut off the land route to to the spices and the funny thing. The two funny things that I i pulled out of reading the entire wikipedia page of the voyages of christopher columbus were uh one that he did. It wasn't that people thought the world was flat that was obviously a myth but that he massively miscalculated the circumference of the earth. If america was not there he would absolutely die he would have been they would have just ate each other on the boat and then yeah yeah. Like there'd be. There would be some undiscovered island in the middle of the ocean where like a bunch of bleached bones and and shipwrecked chunks of the nina are just like floating just sitting on the on a beach somewhere. The other thing that I thought was very funny is that like first that first round of explorers who got to america columbus were like extremely disappointed because they were like they're no spices here yeah and then they're like oh there's cold okay. We'll get the gold yeah but they want it but it took a few yeah. He literally like ran a uh ran like a protection racket on the local natives to try to get squeeze gold out of them and they were like there's not gold here dude. I don't know what you're talk that was one of the big like red pill like left wing red pill moments for me as a kid is when I found out no. They didn't reject columbus because he thought the world was rounded. They thought it was flat. It's because they accurately thought how they had an accurate uh understanding of how big it was and he had an insane crank idea that it was way smaller than everyone else thought it was like it was a catholic church. They weren't saying. It's flat. They're like dude. It's way too big.

But no one knew there was a continent in between us and the  india. So they they he was right classic. American. He kind of missed the first american yeah because he's the he was like he was an idiot who officially was miscalculated. Huge riches absolutely accidentally hit into something that he had no idea was there and then actually I'm a genius. It's so funny that columbus has become like a a lightning rod for um for for like italians claiming like you could not pick a worst attack. Seriously to claim is your duties. As I have said not italian anyway. There is no idea. Not italy italy does not and somebody was trying to tell me what was an ethno-linguistic connection. It's like uh even to this day. Italian is more like uh a like regional and dial like dialect different than like most european countries like there is an almost a mutual inc in comprehensibility between italian dialects. To this day you want to talk about  years like how are they supposed to imagine that they're part of the same polity yeah. Uh italy is imaginary. Uh don't let anybody try to convince you that italy italy's not a real country yeah. Germany isn't a real country either because the thing is like if you're not a country by like 1850 you're not a real government. I only recognize the holy roman empire like anybody who's trying to make a a country in europe after that in europe. Specifically. I would say because of how long there had been polities in europe. If you don't get like a thing together by the industrial revolution you're forcing it and you're getting a tryhard. You're doing you're posting cringe and as we've seen in literally every example of it. If you don't get your  together by 1850 and then try to do it every anyway. It makes everybody. In your country insane yep what a coincidence the two places that founded fascism as a response to the crisis of world war. Ii. Of the depression where italy and germany the countries that just got onto the scene were just discovered or just became together. I mean in that way america just got it in under the wire but honestly jury's still out on that well. We were a thing before the industrial revolution is the thing it's but like 60 years yes but still under the wires under the wire.

No garibaldi is the obvious choice for the for the day garibaldi day who would say no to the garibaldi day. Uh. I mean a lot of people the pope maybe pope wasn't a fan. I mean you know I bet francis would probably be okay with it honestly because he seems kind of chill about it but did gare. Beldi ever come to america he uh no but he was invited to uh be a general in the union army by some enthusiastic uh uh republicans in 1860. That's cool. I think the thing about columbus is that you have to be an italian guy who came to america but he didn't come to america the way these people imagine america like their native america is the continental united states yes and he did never set foot on the continental united states. He made it to the mainland of central america but not yes the continent and if either if you were born there now would most of these goombas who talk about it. Uh columbus consider you uh an american. No no if you're from the dominican republic or haiti do. They consider you an american absolutely not no give me a break fall out of here. Garibaldi come on the yeah not only attack he made italy the march on road for god's sakes. The red shirts he made the country into a thing like he's the first italian of any kind. He is the first italian god uh garibaldi didn't go to the united states. Somebody reminds me of this he did go to south america. He was actually a bank robber in argentina oh that's cool yeah. No he was like a brigand and like a like a like a gorilla guy. He no garibaldi is one of those like world. Historical figures who are just you read about him and you're like how is this a real guy like john brown yeah yeah. You read it as how is this a real guy just in terms of not only having a pretty naturally like modern moral sense. That's transcendent moment but also the will and ability to use that moral sense and turn it into something meaningful kind of un unbelievable as opposed to columbus who is basically just a  dumbass scam artist trying to like wheel some money out of the bankers and uh the queen and the queen of spain yeah and you're doing everything with his like six sons yeah. His yeah. His six large adults six large adult sons rolling across the place.

Uh giuseppe garibaldi folks people more and more they're recognizing that he's great he's wonderful because yeah like give the give the day goes a day give him a day. Everybody can find have a day uh we'll celebrate uh as I partially italian myself. I would nominate celebrating the mutual day of uh garibaldi and gaga yeah yeah. The two visions of italian excellence. That's that's yeah though that is it the masculine. The feminine the historical in the present people politics and and art yeah absolutely all right if who would you want. You're also irish also irish well. They have st patrick's day. I am patrick by the way not irish welsh. I am the synthesis of the the two most hated white ethnicities of us well because they're the try hard white ethnicities. They're the ones that showed up late and tried to like assert it more as opposed to the wasps of the crowds who are a little bit more laid back about the whole thing about the whiteness deal but if they were going to get rid of st patrick and they should because as I've said he was welsh he's not irish who would you want as like the guy for the irish not bomb the edge.

I like the way he plays guitar. I like his little like uh twinkly effects. It's good uh yeah uh or uh. What's his name phil phil in it from uh uh phil leonard from uh from thin lizzy yeah something lizzie yeah uh him phil lynette and uh. I don't know one of the guys from the uh irish uh revolution just uh doing a bro grabs as a statue yeah. Uh you can't really do there's this guy john m this guy. Uh john not john mitchell david mitchell. I remember his name. He was a hero of 48. He was the hero of the the young young ireland movement and he came to america and like a big speaking tour and there were tons of guys who came from europe after their revolutions in 48 failed like uh koschuth from hungary. There's there's a street in brooklyn named after him. Uh the names of the brooklyn streets are wild. Everybody is either like a northern slave owner or a like uh yeah like a revolutionary from hungary yes so koshuth guys like that. Uh but mitchell uh john mitchell yeah. Uh. I always wonder if it's non-mitchell because that was also the name of nixon's attorney general. But it's uh one ellen center too. But he came to america after you know fleeing the brits after the young ireland rebellion and he was like a lot of these guys. He had a a you know nationwide tour where he was fed it everywhere uh and they asked him about slavery and whereas a lot of guys like uh like uh o'connell daniel o'connell the the the the sort of the godfather of the modern irish. Uh uh independence movement who was vehemently anti-slavery met frederick douglass. When he toured ireland. Uh mitchell came to america and they asked him a slave. He's like oh slavery's good you guys need to keep it. It's great actually when we get enslaved by the brits that's terrible when you guys do slavery.

It's actually pretty cool cool yeah and that was like the tradition for so many irish americans getting on the good side of our brutish. Uh race-based social order. We did a bunch of riots about that right. Yes. Yes. It was like what you were doing to us garbage awful people. You're the most oppressed people on earth doing it to other people.


That's actually cool yes yes. Uh if I was a 19th century guy. I would love to be on that speaking tour circuit that seems like one of the best gigs you can get in the 19th century. Oh god. It was so fun especially because you could do it about anything you just like if you were charismatic enough you could go around and be like you know what uh snorting barley will cure uh your respiratory. Uh ailments there is a guy named colonel robert ingersoll in the post-war.

Uh post-civil war america whose deal was he would go from town to town and he would give speeches about how god didn't exist and everyone would get mad at him but it would all be a big deal. He was an early new year. He was a like an early new atheist yes and he would do the thing he would do the classic thing where he'd say god doesn't exist and if he did and if he did he has he has five minutes five minutes to kill me exactly he would do that yes. He was the first professional atheist yes uh. I'm amazed that no um enterprising god lover didn't just bring a gun to one of those performances and shoot him and be like I'm act god made me do it yeah. You asked for it yeah but the thing is like it really goes to show you know even in a much more god-bothered era. He didn't get killed because at the end of the day it's a fun show people like getting mad people love getting mad you kill him. You can't get mad at him anymore. I'm so mad at this guy and I can't wait for him to come back in six months. So I can get mad at him yeah. It's like the early version of like andrew dice clay coming to your town until and telling you how uh how you guys are all  him oh yeah. The rich history of americans loving of stand up comedy of people uh loving guys random losers coming to their town and telling you how you suck yep but in a humorous way. I mean those are the two strains of uh stand-up comedy either saying how I the performer suck or how you the audience suck yeah yeah. They called him the great agnostic that was his nickname. He couldn't even go into atheism well like. I said 19th century. You don't want to get people too man seduce and bone god.

I like that phrase is that what is all this thing about uh like how biden is going to kill. God's gun. Trump was talking and it's a very indication of his inability to like he knows what he knows vaguely what the people he's pandering to like. But he has no personal understanding or like imaginative understanding of it because he doesn't share it yeah. So he said this is a quote. I believe he said he's gonna hurt the bible. He's gonna hurt. God. It's gonna hurt the bible yeah. He said he's going to hurt the bible and hurt god he said and he also said no with trump with with biden no religion no anything no religion abide in god yeah. He goes no religion know anything but yeah. I mean I would love for biden to get in there and do a complete nihilism oh wait. I can't say nihilism on the stream no oh god oh god. No no you're gonna hawk kill everyone indoor silence you cannot. No. You can't be hog pill. But my favorite thing would just be very funny for biden to get up there or do his inauguration be like um uh everything's meaningless. They're uh look look here. I was uh thinking about my good friend uh uh from back in the life guarding days and he was telling me uh good story. We got on our big corvette and said look joe. Nothing means anything. I would like him to give a speech that is an exact replica of his speech when he voted to invade iraq replacing saddam hussein with god. We're going to. We're going to do targeted strikes to drive the tyrant god from his palace.

Roman control in heaven yeah. Uh no but like him saying hurt. He's gonna hurt god that really does tell you all you need to know about trump's understanding of like. The supernatural con like god is just like another real estate developer who might like have to deal with higher taxes or bad pr or something god his underlying. It's very down right. Now he's not making much money yeah. It's not very. It's like biden's in there and you know what he's not talking about god god. His cue numbers are going down. He's very hurt. Uh this is the biggest we you get you vote for trump. You've ever you vote for me. We're going to have the biggest god we've ever seen a huge. God folks. God's going to be gigantic. He's going to be huge but now that's that's and that really does tell you all you need to know about everyone who all the evangelicals love him. They've. They've lost any any the fig leaf that they really believe.

In anything yeah. They only believe in owning the libs and and uh protecting what they imagine to be their understanding of america. What is that mr show phrase the name of the episode god and religion in the bible. It's uh life is precious and god and the bible from uh that's literally uh like trump trying to to wing it for uh the evangelicals on the uh the talk show on the lifeboat sketch oh the talk shows. Life is precious and god and the bible yep very good. Mr show really did have everything you need to know 20 years ago by the way we now have mustard annies. Yes. We do they they actually invented that product uh and now it exists the dueling political ads yes yes yes greely the third um yeah. There's a lot of stuff in there that feels very of a uh a future moment. Someone is reminding me that that line was a quote a direct quote from a jerry springer episode that one of the writers had watched uh where one of the audience members was like talking about something and said but life is precious and god and the bible and now you just do it in the trump voice in front of a bunch of evangelicals folks. Life is precious god the bible he's gonna hurt the bible. He said he's going to hurt the bible joe biden with a hammer going at it on the king.

James version how how are you going to hurt like. I mean it just shows like what a a a total fixation on the material reality and the self especially as you get older and your ability to like ratio. Sensitivity gets lower. It means that you lose object permanence you lose object permanence and so concepts like god in the bible no longer transcend space and time and they become totally fixed and mutable like he's going to hurt the bible. Like that's. The thing you could do. He's going to hurt god like that's the thing he's going to do like a heavy a wrestler promo video where he rips the bible in half like it's a phone book somebody. Uh chatted the phrase uh curb stomp the bible which I think is a funny phrase. I like that I gotta tell you he gets up there on january 20th in front of roberts right and you know you gotta do you gotta put your hand in the bible instead of putting us out of the bubble he just slaps. It just slaps it just slaps. It pulls out a chainsaw like it's a sam raimi movie yeah just chops it yep yep and just pulls a a paperback copy of the the god delusion and gives it to  uh robert. I'll be sworn in I'll be swirling on this check um. But uh uh.


It's been very funny that uh. I I saw that trump was also on the um. The the water pressure tip today again yes. So he's there's a high. I would say 60 000 dead people. There's five issues going into this campaign oh the water pressure is there. Joe biden is an is an atheist anarchist and water in two ways because he loves the boaters and he hates the bad water pressure. He loves yeah. The water needs to be you need water to float your boat and you need to just  lay your skin off you. When it comes out of the you need to be the kramer in that episode of you gotta flush 15 times and the thing is he's kind of right about that in that with the flushing like the low flow toilet go off king. This is a classic example of liberal good do-gooderism. It's like yes let's let's conserve water with our toilet flushes you forget. This is the united states of america.

Every one of this eats three meals of like 90 protein a day. Yes those dumps are like  photon torpedoes. They're not going to go down with one low flow flush to uh actually see a a real analysis of the the volume of american shits versus. I don't know like a norwegian or a french yeah like we're eating. We're eating beef for three meals a day. It's just. I know I've already had two servings of beef. There you go. It's like. It's a supernova of dump. This thing can't be handled by a little a light oh one and a half gallons that's not gonna do it. You need three to four gallons minimum in america for the dumps that we put out unless we stopped eating as much meat which we're not going to do the the water twice a week and it's the size of the uh css hundley.

Every time somebody pointed out in the the chat with just imagining trump's turds that that seems among the things that is most maybe a you problem that he talks about yeah yeah yeah but well the thing is is that yeah. He has no real relation to normal things so like literally. I don't think he's ever exchanged money for services in person in his life. Here's a real question. I know it's like you know he's the cheeto. He's the the orange man is bad. He's the goddamn cheetos but I am fascinated with his makeup as just a physical ritual. Because does he do it. Himself go to the bathroom. No the makeup oh the makeup does. He have a person like. I'm thinking about because always trying to think about trump's relationship to the physical right mundane world is always so much very surreal yeah does.

He have a person is there a white house makeup artist who does it every day because I've noticed that I think since the pandemic started it's gotten worse. It really looks really bad right now and yeah. The makeup is looking really really bad a little orange circle around his face it cuts off cleanly you can like right lines in a way you didn't used to be able to see yeah and there's that the picture from him coming back from oklahoma yeah yeah where he's got just ring around the collar bright red on the collar of his shack so my question is does. He does he wake up every morning and spend an hour applying a like a full face of bronzer yeah and then go out and then at the end of each night does he like take cold cream and wipe all the  off his face. That's these are all very important questions and I don't know it's really my. I would like to know because every since his be the beginning of his presidency. One of the things that's always been most mind-boggling to me has been imagining him in the lincoln bedroom at a vanity with like like the scene in zoolander where he's taking off the coal and just wiping off everything yeah.

Uh he's playing goodbye horses yes uh yeah because there's two conflicting instincts in me. When I think about does he do it himself one is well he has to do it. He can't do it himself he can't do anything himself. No he's baby but at the same time every day his entire adult life. There's someone like there at what like he gets uh. He sleeps three hours a night or whatever he's up in the morning watching foxy friends somebody's there at 6 a.m to  put the stuff on his face every day yeah that also seems hard to believe. But I also have and also seen him doing it and also if that person exists. Why don't we know their name that would be one of the the president's literally most intimate advisors that's true they'd be they'd be with him longer than most people people in a day in an incredibly intimate way yeah that's true. This is why this question really like get gets to me yeah and over. I mean I like to ima i. I really do enjoy imagining him doing actual like mundane tasks. I love making a sandwich.

I love imagining him trying to make food shopping is very amusing to imagine imagine him doing the what was it driving a car. Uh I when you so you guys were talking about trump driving a car on the um on the episode and I tried to look up to see if I could find any evidence of him driving a car and I could not do it. I don't think he's ever done it. I don't think he's ever been behind the wheel of a vehicle under power in his life. Like he got he got in the truck in a golf cart. He can get he can do a golf of course. It does but there's a thing where he's driving the truck you know in the front house which is but it was not under power yeah and firing a gun to me is the most funny he his arm would rip off just him trying to manage if you just gave him not like a nine. Not a 22 or something you give him like a 45 or something like a cop's gun yeah and you make him like just fire without a warning. I'm just imagining the ripples that would happen through his body and then like the absolute like shock and horror and how he would try to recover of it in public yeah. Imagine him shooting a gun in public is very funny yeah like going to like trying to butch it up for a uh like a like a bunch of nra guys and like going to a rifle range and shooting a rifle in public yeah and and I mean it's not like they would not abandon him. Obviously. They would still think he was an alpha but I would be very interested in the specific way that they processed his girlish failure to not look like a a a little girl. The cartoon thing where you like shoot the thing and immediately fall over in a 90 degree arc yeah yeah or like you you don't wreck you get the recoil and you hit yourself in the face yeah. Exactly a shiner something like that yeah.


Uh should we do like questions yeah. Let's do some questions if anybody has any we've just been ripping. I'm sorry to maybe uh. To bomb to bomb these chats I mean i. I am the only person maybe the only person maybe some people uh listen to them all. But I listen to every single one of these since. I put them on youtube so I figured uh. I'd come over or set one of these up if I was coming over here today and this is uh. This is like gonna be hopefully what we do more of if we can set up the uh yeah. Now that. I think we're a little more comfortable just like you know being the two uh two of us in an office setting. I think that that is probably fine yeah is there any more of that tequila or is it all gone. I think I got rid of it. I brought over a little a little thing of um the rocks tequila tiramana tequila which I found a supplier of near here uh so in our own in our own small way matt and I because we have been consuming. Terramondo tequila are now both investors in the uh xfl. Oh right. He bought the xfl. What's he gonna do with it. I have a rock the rockology group chat and we've been very much speculating. First of all he got it for 60 million dollars which I assume means he just bought the brand. It's not like the xfl has like offices or employees or I mean. I think he did buy its assets but there are not that many yeah it's mostly the brand but then there are assets minimal assets so at that point you're not you're getting a brand and you're not getting much risk. I doubt he's gonna launch a full  league of games yeah but if you can like generate a few expo games in like the spring like networks are always going to want to run football. It might. He might just do like a reality series a reality he loves reality series. He's hosted like five reality shows since he became famous yeah which honestly.

I find that a little uh low rent yeah and I think that's because he's from the carnival wrestling circuit. He doesn't understand the idea that there should be a brand that needs to be like protected. He kind of says yes to everything yes and you got you got to get it while it's hot well you're hot. I get that. But like I uh it's I mean maybe. It's maybe that is more in turn with the moment and more understanding of the nature of like our you know terminal end state here where you can't be assuming that you're going to have any broad brand to build on in the future so just strike while the iron spot say yes to everything. But it it does rebel against my my sensibility of a guy who's that big of a  wrestling. He doesn't have that the grinding uh tom cruise doesn't own a tequila company either. He does not. He has no brands yeah. He's never done a commercial has he he probably has at least once folks. It's tom cruise tom cruise ever done an ad in the united states or internationally yes. I'm thinking about it. He might have done one internationally but like maybe a japanese ad everybody does like a japanese yeah like schwarzenegger does japanese man um but yeah. The xfl. Thing is a little baffling just because he the rock is such like a success win mindset and literally everyone who has ever taught like the xfl has just been like a boondoggle who has only caused humiliation for every everyone who has touched it. No. I mean it failed once already.

It's a field twice already they tried to bring it back like a year ago yeah well. I mean it failed once and then they brought it back and they failed again. So I don't know people don't get that like sports are huge in this country. But one of the things that makes them huge is that they are monopolies and that they have that anti-trust exemption uh that that the thing that makes them special the thing that makes them things. People care about is that they are prescribed yes like you only get them for x number of months. A year. You only get them with x amount of talent like a certain amount of talent that you attract with the amount from a single source from a single source and that a thing like that is not uh. It's not. There is no there's not a huge hunger for off-brand versions of it yes which is what the xfl is. It's off-brand. It's low rent and people don't want low-rent versions of sports and the only thing it's literally extreme like if you really want low rent versions of sports watch. College sports which is for and college sports to me is for sickos who get off on the idea that they're not getting paid of punishment yeah. They're like ah yes cass perform for free. Yes you're not getting paid at all. For this you're being ordered around by a little tin pot martinet psychopath coach who has the power of life and death. He could cut you at any moment. He's also the most well paid the most well-paid employee of the state. Yes yeah. Oh yes you could be catch with any moment and you'll be you'll be cast at the poor house. Unlike unlike the professional sports where they get the mouth off and where they get paid a lot of money and they can't be bossed around. It's for the real sickos. It's for the real perverts but like there's no third thing yeah. Hey they're still getting paid but less but that's because they're less talented. But they can maybe hurt each other more. I mean you'd have to make that explicit yeah like you would have to make the xfl genuinely dangerous my idea for if if this if this could be done safely. Uh just put like uh randomly like six concussion minds in the ground of the the football so just like once again or like six times. A game somebody just uh not killed but just like you know blown into the air. A few feet yeah well or killed oh hey.

A little uh squirrel buddy just ran across yeah. We got squirrels back here. It's delightful little guys uh all right any. Uh any any any cues any any questions in the chat. So we can take a few before we do. I grill. No. I do not grill because we live in new york and one of the biggest premiums here is outdoor outdoor space and I have longed for outdoor space but my last I've never been able to find one in an apartment. I've literally considered renting an apartment that was about literally like 200 or 300 square feet of apartment space but with a like 600 square foot balcony attached to it yeah and that was a pretty compelling offer to me because I was like. I don't know like six months out of the year. I could just live outside but no I've never had outdoor space. So I've never had a grill uh. I'm not. I'm okay grilling. I would say I'm competent manning a grill but I'm not a master griller yeah. I have by far the smallest department of any but on the show. But that's because I get some outdoor space and I have to say I mean. I didn't know this was gonna happen when he got the place but now with uh corona and quarantine. I'm incredibly happy that. I had some yeah. It's nice to just my next. My next grilling project is that after I smoked that pork and you had some it was good right. It was good. It was good i. I want to do an all-day brisket with the snake method. I was watching a kenji lopez alt video about this. I'm gonna do it method. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna pick a day. Maybe this month have everybody over and I'm gonna try to get that. Alarm set and like start cooking that thing at like six in the morning and I'm gonna try to do all day yeah like 10 hours of a brisket with with the uh with the snake technique. I'll have backup if it doesn't work. I'll have like burgers and stuff. But that's that's the that's the next project grill wise.

Uh. I like this one uh abrahamic prophets ranked oh wow who who who are your gods of the abrahamic. I don't really like any of them honestly the whole abrahamic tradition. I think it was a swing and a miss. They just really. I understood they're going for like like creating an imaginative architecture to compel behavior. But yeah yeah uh in the modern era. Society needs a daddy yeah and the thing is it does but uh it it. It has not worked out. It's it's definitely led to uh. I think that I mean. I don't know. I can't. I can't really uh come say this confidently. But uh there's there's some deep deep psychos. There's a lot of psychology. There's a ton of psychology well. I mean it's. It's an attempt to it's an attempt to uh. I mean. It's an attempt to create a unified like uh moral social order out of the terror and and and uh uncertainty and uncertainty of like you know scarce tribal conflict and and in that respect it's it's. It's you know it. It's as inevitable as any other uh outgrowth of culture but in the modern era over time the the it drags a lot. It's like you know uh fast five when they're robbed. They have the safe it's kind of the safe. That's on the that's smashing around destroying everything as they're driving. That's a good way to describe it because certainly at this point and we were just talking about the trump stuff at trump and faith. It seems like this weird especially on the political culture. This weird appendage that just kind of hangs out out off the back yeah and just smashes the  out of everything yeah.

Someone says buddhism is a coherent philosophy for cope to which I say yes. Because coping is what life is yes coping is the challenge of existence life is cope. Life is cope what do you think you think you can transcend that you think you don't have to cope are you. That has a hard deadline at which point it turns into goo and that is also your consciousness and your understanding and the entire universe and it's gonna go away. It's going away even if you work even if you're peter thiel and you think oh no. I'll just I'll just dope myself with teenage blood until I can go into the singularity congratulations. How long are you gonna be in the computer even if that works before the  silicon breaks down. Even if it's a hundred thousand years. What happens at the end of a hundred thousand years you have to cope. Coping is like learning that you actually have to cope and and accepting it that you can and breaking through the delusion that there's any way to transcend the the the trap. The the the inherent uh uh tragic trap of existence is is is the first step towards real maturity as a person. That's uh that's a good way to spend your twenties from the endless possibility of being a teenager to the uh constrained reality of being a uh a  a finite being like being and it's like that's there's nothing wrong with that but you have to accept it. I.e cope with it uh.


I like the person who said I am become cope uh best fast food nugget uh the two that come to mind wendy's is good. I don't know the thing about the nugget is not one of my favorite fast food items. But the mcdonald's nugget has the thing of being a nugget and also being a mcdonald's food which means it has that mcdonald's the patina of mcdonald's got that mcdonald's flavor which is unique which you can't get anywhere else and which is something that if you've had it kind of becomes a recurring craving which is literally what they designed it yes so. I gotta go with mcdonald's because it it it satisfies that uh that like basal desire for mcdonald's chemical flavor profile mm-hmm the the grimace aura. That's somebody in the chat exactly yes you can you. It's not that you can just taste it. You can feel the grimace you can feel the grimace you eat it and you see the grimace on the just floating hovering over the horizon nodding at you like uh like saint dominic or or the madonna during a holy vision. Yes just have just imagining somebody stricken with uh stricken with malaria in a in a litter having their forehead dabbed by one of their retainers and on the verizon. They they're seeing like ignatius loyola uh uh mary mother of god and and the grimace. I think uh con uh constantine uh collapsing to his knees bridge looking up and there's the grimace by this sign you shall conquer yes. It's a big purple smiling oaf uh what else is in. Here.

Uh do you guys like arby's yes. Arby's is good. Barbie's is I'm I'm really happy that uh bill oakley has made one of his missions to rehabilitate arby's barbies is good because arby's is not only is the classic roast beef sandwich with horsey sauce just really good and something you can't really get anywhere else no no. It's a unique fast food thing which isn't which is unique yeah. Like there's a unique intelligence there's something unique at wendy's there's nothing unique in mcdonald's. There's nothing you can get a burger at all. This weekend only place you can get a pile of thin gray. Uh roast beef with the horsey sauce horseradish the most underrated condiment. Oh horseradish can't find it at any other. Arby's but in addition to that arby's actually has an insanely ver uh uh deeply uh varied menu. They've got stuff that you got brisket uh. Yes. They've got like italian sandwiches they've got like uh. Uh they've got a ton of different you know what they can't get anywhere. They got. Mozzarella sticks they got mac and cheese. You know what uh so subway is uh on doughboys by the way because a real one I would love to.

I would love to finally go on there. I don't it seems like. I don't know what. I would talk about. They've talked about everything at this point. But I have a few friends who've been on dual boys. Maybe. I'll try to get i. I feel like I've dm'd with weiger at some point. Maybe we were trying to do a crossover at some thing. I do have very strong opinions on faster. The the the doughboys chapo connection has been has been needed to happen for a while but we just really haven't uh. I do I do have very passionate views on uh on fast casual and fast uh fast food restaurants uh somebody in the chat. Uh. I think this maybe this is a good combo to be our last one. Uh somebody said chris get matt to talk about music which I feel like is is one of our traditional intersections so uh uh what have you been listening to uh oh boy. I just watched a movie actually last night. I watched the film arkansas. I don't know what that is based on a novel uh and it was uh. It stars vince vaughn liam hemsworth love vince vaughn uh and it's about. It's low level drug dealers. One of the most flattering things that multiple people have said is that I look like vince vaughn you do kind of look. I never thought about that but you do you also you've got. The you got the tall tallness yeah. I got like the kind of brown the same kind of yeah. The hair yes midwestern mick just like him so that's. I wouldn't bring that up unless two different people from two different sources. That said that so. I found it very flattering.

But it's a good movie and one of the things that's best about. It is the soundtrack and it's got a lot of great modern country on it and uh it has uh uh. It's got a great gatlin brothers song in it that I've been thinking about ever since. I saw the movie uh. Oh you let's talk about all the gold in california here's a good uh tangent. Oh. There's the squirrel buddy. Here's a good tangent to um and on something. I think about a lot as like one of the last good days uh in the world. The day we drove from la to sacramento oh god that was so one of the most. It was very fun but also one of the most psychedelic days. I've ever had because that road through california. This would have been like late february when we were traveling on our california tour. We were talking about like whether we wanted to like take longer to follow the coast or just go up that highway straight to sacramento and we ended up wherever is good. I like the i-10 is that is it the 10 yeah yeah and we decided. It. We just gotta get there and so we went through the central valley which is like the the it's the bread basket of america. It's like the industrial heartland of california really seeing what that means going through the central valley and once you hit the main part of the tent and just go up the middle of california that is just uh at the very edge of the horizon. On either side you see maybe the faintest glimpse five. They're saying the five the five uh of a mountain range but until then is just endless perfectly straight industrial farms for six or seven hours and the road is perfectly straight. The highway is perfectly straight uh going up the the center of california and you're just like oh. This is where all the food comes from and it's utterly inhumane yeah. It is so divorced from reality. It's like being on a food colony on mars yeah. No it it is a good if you need the reminder that the ease and convenience of american life is entirely predicated on massive human and animal exploitation. Yeah and the real headline uh the real high point was when we drove past a a five mile wide couch auschwitz. Uh uh and it was we had to hold our breath for the stink and then the car smelled like it for but the reason.

I brought that up is a music discussion because that was maybe my last in addition to being one of the last notable days before uh everything collapsed and we entered quarantine was we spent the entire ride listening to bakersfield country outlaw country. Yes uh just all the classic mural type stuff from uh really good uh george jones yeah uh which I was aware of but had never given like a real deep listen to and that was will was spending on the ones and twos because he's a big fan of that. Um. Amber too amber amber was big into that yeah. No uh. I must the the great the favorite my favorite song. We listened to was the the george jones merle haggard collaboration. I must have been drunk when I said I'd quit drinking which is just a perfect perfect country perfect country title another. I remember driving. I don't even know who does this but uh uh I remember hearing a song while I was driving to do something in college like early in the morning feeling bleary-eyed weary and hearing some countries on the radio called the more. I drink the more. I drink. It wasn't that trip but it was when we were in california on another drive from uh city to city that we realized that the the the cars are the west coast. Talking heads yeah well then yeah that was that was a real like uh uh galaxy brain moment for all of us when we figured that one out because we were like. I was like should we listen to the cars or uh talking heads like ah that's a little too jittery. That's a little bit too anxious for california and they're like what about the cars like yeah. That's basically yeah it's the same. It's the same era. It's it's the same like quality of like you know songwriting and stuff. It's the same general genre. But it's got the california feel to it and of course. There's the cars the cars you gotta drive your cars. It's california.

This is a little spoiler for next week's in and introducing but we're talking about guided by voices and they have one album where they're like. Synth sound like and it's like. I just was joking on that that being like no rick. I we want to have synth on this on the on the album. I think that that's great but like can we maybe can we change the cutoff just a little so. It doesn't sound exactly like the cars. Cynthia's like no absolutely not. You. It's. I've got my settings. We're gonna do that all right.


I think I actually have to get out of here soon so. I think that that may be a good place to stop so much fun yeah. This is so good well. We'll just do this again having having having someone to talk to during this and having somebody focus we love cake and have it that's my favorite page sacramento zone uh no but having somebody to like field. The the chat and to talk with this is fantastic and if we could game two this is gonna be good. So stay tuned. We're gonna yeah. We're gonna. We're gonna try to take near future take the level up uh but until then good vibes bye-bye. We'll see you guys in a bit thanks for uh dealing with the audio at the very beginning thank you for your patience bye.
