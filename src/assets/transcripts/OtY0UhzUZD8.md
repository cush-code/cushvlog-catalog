All right busted flat and Baton Rouge Waiting for a Train I was feeling just as faded as my jeans and Bobby's on the diesel down just before it rained and wrote us all the way to New Orleans. I pulled my hop on out of my dirty red. Bandana I was playing the software Bobby sang the blue yeah windshield wipe. A slapping time I was holding Bobby's hand in mind. We sang every song on that drive a new dreams just another word for another left to lose nothing not me nothing honey that ain't free yeah. I'm feeling good was easy when he sang the blues yeah. Feeling good was good enough for me um. It was good enough for me again from the Kentucky coal mine to the California Sun. Yeah Bobby sang the secrets of my soul for all kinds of weather through everything that we've done your baby checked me from the cold oh one day out near Salinas. Now.

I let him slip away but he was looking for that home and I hope he finds it because I train up my tomorrows for one single yesterday to be holding Mama's body next to mine how do I sound is it roboty again or is it normal please tell me I mean I'm not gonna be able to do anything before it I guess so it doesn't matter okay good. I'm glad I apologize for the robot sound last night. I hope it made sense anyway all right cool. I'm glad everyone could listen to it.

So we're starting our China book a tiny little China book Little China guy little bitty China guy today a little fun little tiny China Jack China man a little marzipan called the China boom honestly it should be the China boom question mark because they're not too down with. He's not too down the author who often Wang not down with the thesis that the Chinese are representing some alternative to the global capitalist order or some inheritor of it He lays out in the intro that the thesis of the book will be that China is one capitalist State among the other capitalist states in the world system and that it is dependent upon the United States and it's and the American headquartered Global order for its coherence and and and state capacity. So we'll see we'll see if he's right and we can talk about it. I might if anybody has a book that like wants to make the argument that China is something different and like it does represent a a phase shift to change I'd be willing to hear it.

But that's not what we're getting out of this book and I have to say having read the first half. You know. It's obviously a very Breezy and and General. But it does paint a strong picture and part of that reason. He does that he does that is because one thing that won me over to the book very early so in chapter one a mark a market without capitalism 1650 to 1850 where he talks about basically the the Qing Dynasty the Qing Dynasty Qing Dynasty the Qing Dynasty. The the manchus the last Dynasty of China the one that was in power during that big. The great diversions between Europe and the rest of the world but also specifically China and right off the bat hang is asking the question why did capitalism not emerge in China and then to answer that question he brings to brings to Bear. A lot of the tools thinkers that I have been really influenced by in the last few years. So I was like okay.

He's correct. He knows what he's talking about carry on because the first chapter is It basically answers that question why does do we find China having to become a capitalist country in the late 20th century and not you know the same time that England was becoming one and the answer that sketched out in this chapter is that while you still you had thriving markets and you had a thriving trade and Merchant economy with manufacturing too with like workers like you had all the stuff that you saw in Europe the stuff that got turned into in Europe capitalism but it was not ever coordinated into a power within the Chinese. State that could assert itself the way that the Bourgeois asserted themselves in Europe now huang's answer for why that is is that there was a interventionist paternalist Imperial over Sovereign. There was you had localized like commercial Networks that could never take over the regulatory power of the state. The way that the capitalists could do in Europe because there was this overarching Authority. The Empire which was able to for one thing was able to intervene in conflicts between workers and Employers in favor of workers which increased the cost of investing in capitalist industry which disincentivizes investment in capitalist industry. Now the reason they're able to do that is because of their robust bureaucratic capacity. The Imperial bureaucracy which is I centrally administered a system to administer the state which has tendrils everywhere and is made up of people who pass the famous Imperial exams. We know that it was a failure to pass those exams that led to the taipan Heavenly Kingdom to be established when somebody got a bad grade on one thank you so not but not. But there's a there's a two sides to this bureaucratic power one. It intervenes and undermines capitalist interests in the in the regions where capitalism is kind of coming into being and two.

It provides somewhere for people who acquire wealth in merchants in Merchants in merchant Investments. It gives them a better option to send their kids and to spend their money because there was so much money. Associated so many so much advancement so much Social um social credit to social distinction and so much like actual cash in the Imperial bureaucracy that Merchant families instead of becoming you know long-term. Dynamic. Like banking families you know like you're medicis and your Rothschilds in in the in the in Europe within a few Generations. A lot of that Merchant wealth gets dissipated. People spend it educating their kids so that they can become high-ranking civil servants which this a a different from this sort of phenomenon is another reason that France is a reason that France relative to England. Has a later capitalist development because the the French practice of selling offices and making the selling of those offices inheritable gave the the cap the people who had money in early modern France a incentive not this risk it on a speculative Colonial Ventures or or risky Finance schemes or or or Capital intensive and therefore dangerous industrial schemes just by offices you get a better return. So this means that there is no autonomous organized capitalist class emerging amongst all this capitalist action that's happening in the early modern period when China gets a wash in silver. Basically The commercial economies of China and Europe were supercharged by the infusion of New World American silver and why is that pure old-fashioned exploitation. It's all at the end of the day. It is grinding money gold out of blood and and it was doing that that that created this commercial revolution but in China there were all these things militating against the organization of autonomous Merchant Society Merchant groups.

But if you were but the thing is Chinese Society just like European Society created people who buy inclination and interest and ability wanted to be capitalists wanted to do Merchant stuff but what did they do in China. Now in Europe they took over. They literally coordinated to Take Over Control of their smaller and therefore more easily conquered medium-sized States as opposed to the Untouchable Chinese Imperial state which has so many interests within it be that go beyond and contradict the interests of the merchants in the cities they have to Emperor. That's that's how you lose the Mandate of Heaven. It's getting the Merchants have to say their influence is nothing but they so they couldn't fight the state. Some of them stayed and you know kept grinding it out in China but a lot of them left and they created Chinese diasporic Merchant colonies all through Asia from Taiwan to Macau to southeast Asia and Indonesia a Manila Philippines where they were trading with Europeans and trading with locals and it's very interesting you see in Asia. A recapitulation of the sort of cycles of pogromes that happened to Jews in Europe but against Chinese colonies in the rest of Asia because the Chinese in those cities stood for what Jews stood for in the European. Context the merchant class the people who held your banknote. The pawn brokers the people who in a burgeoning merchant Society are on the top have the have the upper hand in these in this new marketized world that peasants and recent peasant arrivals to cities can't compete with and they get pissed when things go bad and they go and they beat people up and of course they think it's.

They think it's because they're Chinese just like European status because they're Jewish but no it is an expression. It's a folk expression of alienation and fear at being immiscerated in this new way in a way that you can't fight against but there's nowhere to fight. It's a mystery. It's a phantom. It is not. It's it's a it's. It's a ghost so you can only take it out on people but anyway what this means is that China just kind of stagnates there. And it doesn't really get forced to try to do modernity until the European gunship show up and basically force them into the new trade economy. So that's the first chapter that going through that history and I really like it because it echoes a lot of the stuff I've been saying so I love being affirmed. Yes I'm correct thank you. But I I this is why I love the shadow book so much by the way I keep talking about the wolf. The Walter scheidle book end of rum because the thing that gets you as a kid is the fact that when you do the but why thing with an adult you get to the point where everybody just kind of puts their hands up you know and that's true of so many attempts to explain historical phenomena and sociological phenomena.

You just sort of have to shrug at a certain point but with the shital thesis you know you get to an answer a question that has a definitive answer and that does not beg another question because with with huang's description here of the Chinese Imperial State intervening to prevent capitalism from merging why would they do that the answer he gives is because the paternalistic ethics that mask the material interest in maintaining stability. The emperor wants to maintain stability and capitalism capitalist action capitalist behavior is destabilizing inherently so of course he wants to stop it. The reason Europe got capitalism is because no Sovereign existed who could impose that will from that from that. Position you had these small to medium-sized States which could be taken over effectively by their Bourgeois because everybody was trying to get money to fight Wars with each other. They had Wars to fight with each other if they lost the wars they would lose their Dynasty and so they empowered these merchants and these financiers in order to fuel their war machines and that means they give over their own sovereignty because the the because that long-term sacrifice in their minds is better than in the short term being dispossessed by losing an existential war with one of your other European Rivals and of course.

All of that is you know being fueled by class. Conflict at the base like you have to fight and Conquer because you have no stable Center in a class Society but shadowed us further because you can say well why do they have a why do. They have a step nomads because the the risk of attack from a completely different social order that is able to mobilize military effectiveness at a level that a settled Society simply cannot do because of the necessity necessity of a division of labor and Will Roll Over You. If you do not fully mobilize against that threat and there's and then you say well why did they have to worry about that and the Europeans didn't the answer to that because that is where the step is and you're done. There's no ways to step there right the steps there because that's where the step is we're done that's why I love the Shiloh thesis because it gets you to literal bedrock.

So you got this dying Ching Dynasty that's being racked by internal conflict. There's they have this Balancing Act between the the the rural landowning Gentry the Imperial bureaucracy the local authorities and local magnates of the various trades and industries and then the peasantry who are for the most part free free tenants. They pay. They had they owed money to a landlord but that's it the feudal arrangements had been smashed thousands of years ago But what that meant of course is over time There's a dispossession at the bottom you get people shaken out of ownership and specifically the people who moved from northern China to Southern China. The the haka they moved from northern China desolate prone to attack by step nomads to the more Rich lands of the South where they have no stake where they have no property and because they're starting from the bottom have a difficult time acquiring any so you've got this restive population fight. You've got this constant class conflict of the countryside caused by this sort of friction between the landless Farm laborers peasants and and landowners and now you've got the West showing up and say hey you guys got to buy our opium or else. We're going to blow you up because you otherwise you have you've been taking all the silver. We haven't we need to rebalance the third trade. We need to make you buy this opium because we know people will smoke it and right. After that you have the taiping Rebellion. It's this collapse and so there's this frantic effort after the taiping are put down to like China like Japan did at the same time modernize but all you're really doing is empowering these Regional military Powers. These Warlords who had been empowered to defeat the taiping and then after the war becomes centers of regional power that are able to grab all that Surplus that's being organized.

[18:36](https://youtu.be/OtY0 zUZD8?t=18m36s)

Now that's being rationalized and put it towards their little military fiefdom which is not creating the dynamic commercial economy that you would need to compete with the West like it's interesting so when the when the Ming Dynasty collapses in the mid 1600s. During the same little ice age. Ecological crisis that caused 30 years more in Europe and um several ottoman Sultans being overthrown in a very short period of time They lost the Mandate of Heaven for the same reason that all those other forces did and there was as it happened historically a bandit King a disaffected postman who got fired and then went in the hills and became a bandit. King led a huge host that rolled their way to the Capitol that had happened historically that was how that was the cycle of Chinese history. But this time one of the generals of the of the Ming who's guarding the Gate of the Great Wall to keep out one specific step nomadic group. The man the man shoes invites them through the gate with the Proviso that they would help him restore the main so that last Dynasty overthrow something he gets about a year in power before the manchus roll up and then once they get in. There. They realize oh this machine has completely rotted away. We can just take it over and then so there's this violent bloody. Prolonged War between the remnants of the Ming and the the Manchu and they eventually take over through their military. Basically the contractors they hired and at the end of the Manchu when the taiping have taken over the most productive lands between the yellow and Yangtze Rivers like they had taken over the heart the middle of the Middle Kingdom.

 the the man she was held on because of Western military and intervention on behalf of them because they wanted somebody that they knew that they could deal with whether than rather than some weird millenniary freak who might decide to you know do communism or something and also the empowerment of these local military leaders who are given a ability to grab Surplus to create a machine that can take down the Taipei and once it does these are new nodes of power that well so that by the time the Republican Revolution happens in 1911 I believe they're basically sunyat sen and his buddies are just taking over an empty their their storming an empty Palace. The power is out in these warlord areas and so that leads to this slow steady consolidation as the nationalists and the Communists Allied largely because of Stalin's insistence. Roll up through these these warlord fiefdoms and supporting them to a central Authority foreign. This is the second chapter primitive accumulation that we're on now and of course. Eventually the the nationalists betray the Communists d they're destroyed in the cities in part because of a very ill-advised strike.

General strike attempted in Shanghai once again the insistence of Stalin that gets massacred and leads to the the party sort of re arranging itself where among what social base the base that is historically overthrown Empires that had lost the Mandate of Heaven. The dispossessed it land the dispossessed landless hawk of peasantry of the South but the nationalists can't hold power if the Chinese the Japanese invade Japanese are defeated. The Chinese nationalists are kicked off of the Mainland and you have now finally sort of I what I can sort of consider the completion of the taiping Rebellion which is the victory of the Chinese Communist Party. Because what it is is it is the it is the modern challenge to the not just the the the specific regime of the Qing Dynasty but of the notion of dynastic Politics as it had as it had been understood and the assertion of a nationalist.

A national. A modern National concept that of course because it's reacting to sort of a stultified social order has to involve a a ideological um structure that is from that is imported from above abroad. It has to be imported from abroad because capitalism is being imported from abroad the Hong Kong that was capitalism showing up and so a new China had to respond to this and that that had to be a Chinese response and so first it's the guise of Christianity and then Marxism which of course one is the continuation of the other. The attempt to find a human heart in the social and economic machine that we're living in so when the when the Chinese or the Communists take power. They are now locked in a new world created by the the world. The the the internationalization of capitalism we have now reproduced the medium-state competitive framework that had dominated Europe and that led to the rise of capitalism. We have exported it to the world. Now everybody is a medium-sized state fighting with every other state for existential survival which is the survival of the specific regime of power and so what do you do you have to build your productive forces and how do you do that the same way everyone does it.

There's only one way to do it. There's no weird trick to defeat this. It is mass exploitation and domination of peasantry. It is taking people who work the land and making them work harder as we said as I've said before like farmers only work as hard as they have to because it sucks to do. It's. It's it's it's tiring work. You wouldn't work harder than you had to so you work to sustain yourself. That's not enough to create the surpluses that you can direct to investment and make modern technological capitalism. Possible allow you to compete with the other states. So that is why the Russians had did what they did. That's why the the famines and then the collectivization. The Chinese did the same thing the Great Leap Forward. First. They tried to export industry to and make it a small scale in the countryside. Because that's where people lived they tried to not uproot them. They're going to have people smelting pig iron in their backyards like next to the bar and of course that was absurd because the whole reason the cap that industrial capitalism works is that it brings together Capital that it concentrates. It's like it concentrates Surplus. It does not distribute it s job is to bring it into a center like you're doing the opposite and that helped lead to 30 million people dying which is exactly what they needed. They needed to free up that goddamn land you cannot have a change in a mode of production without some drastic change in the relationship between the people and the land. Feudalism was in terminal decline or it's in terminal stagnation.

 when the first plague ship showed up from in Venice or whatever um. There was too many people on too little land that had lost that was no longer. The the land was losing its fecundity. It was producing less with more work. It's it's a downward spiral and there was no way to break it up. Then. The black death comes and people start being able to move people can negotiate different deals with landowners and specifically they can move through the cities and it's that urbanization that starts that sets off the Cascade of reactions by different Elites that lead to the specific bringing together of different Innovations in the specific place that is then exported elsewhere and here's of course.

[27:37](https://youtu.be/OtY0 zUZD8?t=27m37s)

The real joke all the horrors that are put at communism's doorstep. The millions killed by communists though that is the price not of Communism but of primitive accumulation which necessary which must happen to have any kind of advanced technological society and it is you have to concentrate the agricultural Surplus and that means making peasants work more than they want to that means introducing the market market compulsion or a barrel of a gun one way or the other depending on the the sophistication of your Machinery. Now the reason that capitalism gets off the hook is because all of their famines all of their repressions happen to people who don't count to be part of the polity. Like I was listening to one of the wrap-up episodes of Mike Duncan's revolutions podcast about revolutions and he's or no. It was one of the last ones about the Soviet Union and he's looking back at collectivization and he says like the Soviets did this amazing thing of creating out of a medieval Backwater a modern industrial economy in like 20 years that is revolutionary and Wild and then he says but when you look at the horror that that required and then you look at like the way that England for example industrialized. 

There's so much less violence and horror you know there's other ways to do it. No he is forgetting that that violence and horror all happened it just all happened in India. It happened to Indians and not just this and by the way not just the deaths from from famine but also all the best from repression all the all the gulag. All the all the arbitrary detentions and executions that is the reality of colonial Administration but because it happened to this other the process at the center gets off the hook I mean that's how it's allowed to go that long because it displaces the horror we would not countenance the horror what allows us to count since the horror in this case was distance but in the 20th century is the creation of an actual Living Faith communism that can activate Behavior. We have to do this and by many measures they all did.

The Soviets were in a situation where they had no other option the reason that a Thug the reason the gang leader a criminal and not some sort of Soviet like worker intellectual took power is because the thug was the only one who had the stomach to do to the stomach to embody what. Was going to have to happen if the Soviet Union was going to survive. Now there were people who said maybe don't let the Soviet Union survive like bakarin buy off The Peasants and and and get us off the train to modernity and I gotta say that might have been the right move I kind of think. It was the right move but that would have meant the dispossession of the Soviet ruling class the the party and they didn't want to do that who wants to give up their power and it not even because of selfish reasons because you don't trust anybody else to have the vision or faith to do it right yeah.

So like the horrors of Crick. The Black Book of Communism is just one chapter in The Black Book of modernity. The Black Book of capital the greater Black Book of capitalism because everybody is forced. Once capitalism is capitalism is established to adapt and that is why the Bolsheviks all banked on a World Revolution so that they wouldn't everyone wouldn't have to do what had already been done in terms of horrible brutal exploitation that you could slow the pace at the center slow the pace of accumulation and then redistribute Power to modernize at like a retail speed rather than at the wholesale. Butchery demanded by capitalism but if you're one state among many whether you're the Soviet Union or Mouse China you are a capitalist state because you have to respond to capitalist incentives in the world. Market. I don't know how you can argue against that honestly so they had so they industrialized on the back of the peasantry. 30 million died in the 50s but then what's this in the 60s thanks to a huge program of rural development and the CR and a rural health care and literacy system. All of a sudden education rates literacy rates life expectancy quality of life in the peasant in the rural area excuse me in the rural areas goes up. They were able to actually direct that Surplus yes it killed 30 million people but it didn't just go into capitalist.

Pockets willy-nilly the way it does when it happened in India. That's the difference between India and China. At the end of the day is Dad Lenin or they had Mao just like Russia had Lenin and they had Gandhi so. What this gave them is this ability to invest infrastructure ports factories like power capacity that gives them the ability to to do the things you need. You know to offspin economic activity from from a center of dynamism and even extend some of that to the rural communes because they did do full collectivization in the countryside as they had in Russia because that's what you got to do. You don't think they did that India it wasn't collectivization. They didn't put them on but what they did is. They said hey your old system of handicraft like production and your system of like cyclical provision of like cyclical storage of surplus for future use to mitigate against changing conditions.

Because the the those those those famines in India are cyclical. There is a cyclical drought everywhere but historical peasant life. Subsistence lifestyles of the Indians had allowed for the creation of like Surplus to be reserved so when there was a a drought The the Raj forced Indians into a market relationship that meant that there was no more place to put any Surplus but on the market and so you say oh my God. They're horrible that's horrible. They did it on the backs of the peasantry well.

[35:04](https://youtu.be/OtY0 zUZD8?t=35m04s)

You know what that means though they didn't have to borrow money to do it. They didn't have to borrow a bunch of like the Eastern black. Poland had something like 44 of their GDP was debt By the time of the the volcker shock because she had first the petrol dollar flush of the 70s when all of a sudden the oil boom means there's all this petrol money that it's not staying in the Saudi. The Saudis are keeping it they're putting it back out there so it goes into bank accounts and it gets lent back out at a certain rate of interest and it got lent back out to all these countries that were trying to borrow their way to a development rather than do the due to their passantry and either because their structures well one way or another because their structures wouldn't allow them to do it so they borrowed a ton of money what that means is that when vulture shock comes in and these economies start collapsing and and the pressure on the Soviet block becomes unbearable. China has largely avoided that trap they don't have to do the shock therapy and so that starts with the 1980. They have this capacity that they don't have to give away. They don't have to give off to.

They don't have to sell off which is essentially what happens everywhere else. Although State assets get sold off in the Soviet Union and all those formerly developmentalist States those those former insta import substitution regimes in Latin America and in Africa boom overnight that stuff becomes property of international finance. Capital all that all that capacity that they built up during the Cold War except China China gets to keep theirs and that means that they now have a chance to direct their own response to this new economic conditions as a and this new their new status as like a competitor on the global stage and you could argue that all those deaths were worth.

It and the you could also say that that's a monstrous and that nothing can be thought of in those terms. But the reality is nobody was doing it with the goal of killing all those people they were doing it with the goal of trying to build communists and you could say no you're just building capitalism. But everybody was doing that there is the there is the wiring that were like there's the incentive structure that's that determines our behavior and then there is our imagined story. We Tell ourselves about why we're doing things and those things are not the same and there is conflict between them and if the conflict between those things is politics is us working through like oh. Like what do we have to do and then how do we go about doing it because who we think we are and that's always being done and the tragedy of the Communist capitalist system is that it allows people to act out of real 

Earnest desire to do the good thing but end up reinscribing the worst thing you could do all right so the last chapter is the capitalist boom 1980 to 2008. So this is when they do the the dang Xiaoping who like Mao had his number at first like Mao he was he was denounced and fell from power during the cultural revolution he was purged as a rightist but he was allowed to He was rehabilitated because once the the cultural revolution ends once that energy is sputters out the legitimacy of the regime is completely threadbare. The only thing that's going to keep people on board is rising living conditions not the iron Rice Bowl which was the guaranteed social welfare contract that had characterized Mao as China. The iron Rice Bowl. It was guarantee of of housing education Health Care food now it wasn't always going to be good or a lot of food or or good housing but it was guaranteed but that's in this in the new world in the new commercialized world in the new collected wired world with televisions and blue jeans you can't run on you can't run a regime on revolutionary austerity. You took that as far as it could go the thing cracked and then you had to rebuild so you have to give people a consumer Horizon to replace that extinguished political one and that is what they started doing in the 80s first thing they did was they break up the peasant communes but it but very importantly what they don't do is. They don't change the system the household registration system that China uses to Arbitrage labor costs basically because in China you are your access to social goods is predicated on your place of birth and that is can be waived like right.

Now there's tons of landless workers who've moved to cities but because they moved they don't have those access to those rights basically and that makes them more vulnerable makes you take some more willing to work for less money. So you get the rise of these state-owned Enterprises which become these Regional centers of power because the center sort of disintegrates. During this period. The the power at the center of the the PMC is PRC is replaced by these Regional parties and they're getting more and more discretion over what to do with the money because it's an experimental time the local regions are. It's it's it's it's the it's. It is the the degree in which guys like schumpeter and Hayek are correct is really shown in the way that they did this the way this came about. There was a efflorescence of State money from State Banks going to state-owned Enterprises in regions which were controlled by local party Elites and bureaucrats and and they become these local power centers that are taking on all of this cheap loans that they never pay back and this causes a a problem in the 90s and eventually the rise of Mega companies so out of these sort of regional boom bust cyclers.

These you know you could you could compare them to Andrew Jackson's pet banks in the United States like if you can imagine them building capitalism in in in the 1980s and 90s. The way that capitalism was built in our early American period like the 1820s 1830s you have these these pet Banks that are eventually consolidated. One of the examples that he uses in the book is that there were this there was for a long time in China a patchwork of telephone companies and mobile companies that provided the provided Telecommunications and what happened is they all got brought together and under one name China mobile which sold a portion of its ownership on the stock market. It became a stock that is owned by private companies and it becomes funded by foreign money. The majority share is held. I mean that's that's the key to this entire structure is that all these industries the majority share of ownership is held by the state but but there is a minority share of the state of the of these companies that is owned by a private company corporations which is how privatization happened in the rest of the world. But here it is managed and sort of controlled by a sovereign party as opposed to the way that the fire sale destruction of Communism in the the East Eastern Eastern Europe was met with just the collapse of any ability to prevent anything from getting privatized.

[43:31](https://youtu.be/OtY0 zUZD8?t=43m31s)

Let me see some more of this stuff. So when they get rid of the iron Rice Bowl. They increase the ability your your ability to to make money in these private. Enterprises or these these public Enterprises that are paying out like money to people within it and become you know Patriots Networks so people are making more money. But whenever you get rid of that floor people start falling through it and so you have an increase in unemployment an increase of of social dislocation. A lot of these standard Enterprises because they aren't making money for start shedding employers.

Start employees start firing people and this all leads to a a anti-government movement that culminates at China men that gets misunderstood in the west that's described China square is described as this student uprising of young people who wanted democracy and there were plenty of young people in America in from the better families of the party who were in The Universities and who wanted greater Democratic accountability because in their mind they they because like because the liberalization process is this double-edged sword right. It's it's providing more opportunity. It's providing more a race standard of living for one group of people. While it is there's another group of people who are falling through the cracks they're getting fired. They're losing Access to Health Care housing and they are represented in different Social Circles. There are fewer of those second group of people in colleges so for when they saw the the China around them. In distress.

The students said oh this liberalization of the economy is good. It's working we need a concomitant liberalization of our political system but they weren't the only people at China men. There were people from the working class who were trying to fight on behalf of that iron rice bowl and perhaps on behalf of Chinese socialism and meanwhile a raid against them you had divided what had been a divided polypier and a divided Chinese Communist party. It was divided between the reformists like Zhang Xiaoping who were pushing heavy for economic reforms and then the hardliners who hated that but it turned but the thing about those hardliners is there were a lot of them were in the Army and what they really want the reason that they wanted. They didn't want to get rid of the old. State managed economy. We didn't have anything to do with like liberating the people.

It's because they it's part of their power their conception of control and power. These are the military figures of the regime. They want to run people over. They want to dominate and and State control of the economy is an instrument of domination. Meanwhile the the the reformists they want liberalization but because they think it will give them and keep them in power not because they think it's going to do anything they can imagine. It's for the national purpose but again that's just conflated with their best interest as the people in charge and it's self-interested in both ways. It's self-interested because the ruling class is always self-interested and so they were caught in conflict over the over the over liberalization but bang.

Xiaoping and the reformists were like okay Crush these people because what if we do get the the the the dumb ass Libs think if we get more democracy in China. Then we're going to get more liberalization the implication the real implication of War democracy in China in the conditions of neoliberal Reform is you might get people insisting on actual communism might get people insisting on doing socialism for once of course. The the students some of them understood that and agreed with it. Other ones just couldn't conceive of that because they'd only seen the good side of of the economic liberalization. But both sides of the ruling Elite could agree Crush. These kids because it would give them control and so the deal that was made after China man was. The hardliners get can keep control of the the political structure and the party and the liberalization continues and this goes in the face of everything the dumbass. Liberals had said the Western liberals who insisted no no when you give them a little bit of democracy or you give them some liberalization they will do democracy. The Eastern Europe did fake democracy fake Bourgeois democracy after they collapsed China never collapsed.

It's able to do something that the other post-colonial power countries couldn't do weren't forced first at the barrel of gun and then IMF loans and American interest rates to privatize their economies. So now you have a situation where the party leader the party middle class. They don't want. People might vote themselves socialism and we can't have that so the economy so the Chinese economy in the 90s becomes this collection of little feudal fiefdoms of little patreon networks. Around families which is how feudalism worked and that is how the state enterprise economy of China worked is in the 90s and odds you can argue that chairman Jay is trying to break that up or whatever I don't know I don't think he really talked. I think this book's a little old. So I might not talk about that but we can talk about it. Whoever has more information I don't know that much about what zg's up to but that has been like the conditions of of what's happened is that these local Regional state-owned Enterprises that have foreign Capital but are still controlled by Boards are able to dispense profits are able to dispense Surplus but the thing that really energized the Chinese economy as we of course. Know is their export economy and that was made by a couple of things coming together one the Chinese devaluing of their currency so that it would be have a favorable trade status in the on the global market and then taking all of these healthy educated sort of or

 um I don't want to use the word civilize but Urban I guess in some way like urbanized through media or whatever this new integrated peasant working a peasant labor force and then by neglect and this is the other thing you probably had to plan because they're sending so much money to the cities. They're putting so much money into investing in this infrastructure for these industries. They are by definition putting relatively less money in the countryside. So there's rural underdevelopment in the 80s and 90s. So you have deteriorating conditions in the countryside harder to make money out. There. You have this new concentration of foreign and domestic capital in the cities and it pulls people into them. But because of the household registration system they're put into a legal Limbo by moving to cities which makes them gives them the same.

 precarious negotiating position that immigrants do in the United States and the U.S Mexico border is the same thing as the household registration thing is in China. It is an artificial fantasy line to put somewhere by capital by the states that are administering capital and are administered by it in turn to Arbitrage labor costs to make it so that instead of having to spend more money on more mechanization like that's. The the the capitalist death spiral that Marx envisioned is that it gets it costs too much over time or competition gets you to the point where you're investing so much in your Capital that you get to a technological Tipping Point when there's no more labor going into it and the whole thing breaks down. But what stops that from happening is keeping wages lower in the center so that you can use that that exploitation that Surplus you're getting from that labor that which is all Surplus as opposed to the labor you get out of the machine which is just the labor really you put into the machine actually less than the amount you put in the machine because the you get to live off it but only if there's a permanent external flattener on wages and that is the state saying oh you shouldn't be here so that that that's this big pool of educated civilized rural labor new concentrations of capital. The special Enterprise zones on the coast boom it explodes and it gets interconnected to the global economy so that it becomes this new not even manufacturer.

It becomes the assembler of the world because there have been well. China was in the process of restructuring its economy. There was the Asian tigers that merged all of whom were the beneficiaries of Cold War U.S large s and support while they created sort of protected local wig Style domestic Industries. Because that's the thing if capitalization shows up with a fire hose and you are an undeveloped country. They will prevent you from developing because it will always be more be more profitable for them to just extract your cheap raw Commodities. It will never be more profitable compared to that in terms of return on investment for them as opposed to people in the country who actually get the benefits to industrialize it. You have to have during the Cold War. You had to have Uncle Sam's hand on your shoulder saying it's okay you can you can industrialize. We even did that for the British to an extent we we floated their currency way above what it deserved to be because they were England you know and we didn't want. Their feelings were hurt or whatever and because of the the the the atchison's free.

Crescent theory of of of containing communism through Asia and into the Middle East among producers and extraction extractors like organs of this greater American industrial machine China. In this China develops Industries. Those Industries get more developed before you get to the Tipping Point where you've over produced the less intensive. Less Capital intensive Industries get exported so you had something. They called the the flying geese formation of Europe of Asian economies so you had Japan South Korea Taiwan Saigon and Hong Kong and production of different stuff for American consumption was spread amongst them the highest Tech stuff in Japan second highest in Korea and Taiwan and then the the the least developed the lowest capital production in the Singapore in Thailand. What China does at the turn of the century once it's finagled most favorite. Nation status and entry into the WTO. Is to break all that up and to do all that Manufacturing in China taking every one of those steps and doing it in China. You can't do that in those countries under those capitalist conditions because they cannot organize enough to prevent over accumulation.

In crisis. China can do that and it even stable because that could have led to a collapse of the Asian economy because what are these countries supposed to do now that they can't manufacture this stuff if China is going to produce it all but instead what happens to stabilize it and reorient the The manufacturing economy of Asia away from Japan as American proxy to China is by having China be the place where stuff produced and all those other Asian industrial economies is assembled brought together and then finally shipped to the United States so that's the economy that we are now talking about. That's the economy that is being posited as an alternative to global capitalism. A challenge something else and the second half of the book is his answer to the question. Like is China gonna going to take this boom and turn it into hegemony and I think from reading the preface. His answer is going to be no and we'll see exactly why he'll well. He lays it out next week well that was almost an hour perfectly wow nice nice and disciplined. So the title of the book is the China Boom. By I always forget his name. Ho Fung Hong. That's it so part two is global effects coming demise so that might be a spoiler alert.

There has been very nice. It was raining like crazy here in L.A for a while which was very weird but now it's nice and sunny again. It's crisp. It's fall. I didn't think I could get that anymore I thought it was done. I thought I'd never had another. I'd never have another crisp fall again.

I might if somebody has one if somebody has a book that like is saying hey China China's fresh and it's and they're doing something different. I'd like to hear it because I I mean. I like I said I'm new to it and I haven't studied that much. But I mean from what from what China looks to be doing from the outside. It appears to be a country that adapted to become a modern capitalist State and is now adapting as we're all doing it's not. It's not doing anything other than reacting which is all we can ever do. We're always only reacting billiard balls being knocked around and the Revolutionary fantasy is that we will break through. And I think we will and we have the phenomenon that occurs the question is because China that is it is it eruption and it doesn't seem to be seems to be pretty content to just be a state among states and to see the advancement of its influence. Being you know the same as the as the direct as the drive of any one of these states competing within a framework but dependent here's the crucial part dependent upon that framework. So we'll see we'll talk about it next week. All right folks have a good day peace and chicken grease.
