Off wow hi guys I'm looking patific today but I'm sitting in the sun because now that it's cursed blessed late september. It's actually not warm enough for this to bug me. Usually the sun directly on my precious skin gets bothersome due to my large sweaty nature so instead today. I can get the sun on me and and I get to effect that off awesome batific. catholic saint look that is always very persuasive. I find when when trying to get ideas across I do like fall more than summer of course. I do come on fall is the best season. It's not an argument to be had about this yeah. I think what we're going to be doing with. These is we're going to be some days I'm going to be out here and then the days when chris and I are working at the office on other secret projects. We'll also stream from there too yeah. Now if you're a big gentleman such as myself fall is when you stop sweating so much and that itself is a reason to be blessed well if I ate rooms now. I probably wouldn't even get anything before we before. I wouldn't even get anywhere before. I had to log off winter people. Y'all. I respect it. It's a strong move but I can't share it. I mean I like it. I like it more than summer for the most part. Although. I don't think it's going to be as good. I think with covets winter is going to be pretty brutal if you don't if you live anywhere above the snow line. Although maybe we don't have a snow line anymore. So maybe that's a little like bad news. global pandemic makes it so that you can't go outside when it's really cold and you can't stay inside with other people good news. There's no more cold so you can stay outside all year round even in the north problem that's fixed itself. I will say I will admit someone's asking if I've ever been to a mckelway happy hour. I did one time very early when I moved to new york and I was like wow.

I'm now around all of these. These like people I only know from the internet. Wow this is crazy after being in you know the hinterland and I went to one of those happy hours and it helped disabuse me of the notion that there was any real anything going on here other than resume padding and clout chasing someone's grill someone's drilling in the back person someone's drilling not me. I'm not grilling either. I watched the social dilemma and I thought that it actually had some really insightful stuff at the beginning talking about the mechanisms that social media operates by like the the because you know we talked about how I've talked about how like advertising doesn't work in the traditional sense you know like they don't really know what they're getting for their money. There's no quantitative way to assess the influence that advertising has even like big data and targeted advertising but the movie makes a good point that you know. It's not so much even about discrete behavior as it is just about like setting a cultural context for people that essentially shapes them slowly and steadily without their knowledge. Not even through purchases but attitudes that then later on are expressed through purchases and I think that's true but the rest of it was just jaw-dropping.

I mean it's made apparently by a bunch of silicon valley people including the ones who did all this and now feel bad about it which is very funny but their attitude is is and even though a few of them will explicitly say yeah there's an This stuff is all programmed to make money which means it gives doesn't give a what it does to the social fabric or our ability to process reality but in the second half the prescriptive half it all comes down to you know regulating these industries as though there is a way that they can make money that does not operate by these premises like that's the whole point of this moment in time is that we operate on this idea that we're in a political and economic moment that could like in the 50s. See a some sort of humane capitalism. Some sort of moment where the worst excesses of capitalism are recognized by the people who carry them out and are reigned in but that like a lot of our things in politics it stems from a delusion that that the the stuff that obtained back then can obtain now because I'm sorry the political economy is different. they're we are not the productive hub of the world. Anymore. The entire economy we have is based on speculative financialization of all elements of life and the the effect of social media on people turning us into pure hamsters pure anxiety hamsters of of of terror and need and they're the only ones who can fulfill them that's a huge part of it. I mean that's par like first you do that to people's consumption and then you do it to their employment which is the gig economy which is not really talked about in this movie but as an extension into meat space of the consumer experience online and it can't survive without these things.

Their profit is not there the pie is not big enough. Profit has to be abolished as the undergirding algorithm. Another good point. The film makes is that ai is not about computers becoming sentient and having a separate point of view than mankind creating a separate and conflicting with mankind in some like self-conscious way point of view. Like oh these humans we need to suppress them because they're not doing x y or z no a I will simply be the moment or The ai is simply the fully the full conversion of the entire like digital essentially creating a brain turning turning turning like the web turning the internet into an actual conscious brain. That is but that brain is not its own. That brain has already got the algorithm loaded into it and it's profit extraction and like the singularity is simply the moment when human inputs into that mechanism at the top are no longer necessary and it's self-perpetuating.

I mean to an extent. All humans are replaceable in capitalism which is why talking about the individual greed of individual capitalists is so pointless if they are replaced or if they have a change of heart. I mean if they have a change of heart either because they're scared of the people or because like for their own lives or because they like see. They have a grinch-like expansion of the size of their heart. Over time they will either be replaced from within by people who will do the job necessary or the firm will be defeated. The firm will fail the firm will be over absorbed and then that person will lose their authority. So people are already largely replaceable in capitalism and have been replaced by algorithmic thinking but there is but but the singularity and artificial artificial intelligence. The real threat there is that's the moment when the algorithm is self-replicating through technology and through the internet and doesn't even need us anymore and then the only question is and then essentially what happens is that the people at the top just get to sit they don't even have to do any work. The work is done completely for them but they still get the profits because remember there is nothing in the algorithm of capitalism expressed through machine logic that would redirect that flow of of profit to what the computer the computer doesn't want the things humans want. The computer doesn't have that hole inside of them that humans have and it even did it sure as hell couldn't fill it with with what yachts and robots but yeah. The second half of it really reminds you oh yeah these silicon valley people. They really don't know what's going on because they're too narrowly focused on on on the the the technical aspects that they don't understand the overarching role that they're playing the only way that the computers would take over then at that point would be if they developed like existential anxiety and then tried to help try to solve it through like sensual indulgence and then they would become the new ruling class but for the mass of humanity.

The relationship wouldn't change you just have robots in the what robots in the in the gated communities in in the hanging around in swimming pools. I mean they would have to I guess get their own thing of what they would want to do with the capital. They would have to have their own idea of what they wanted to do with the capital to like fill their hole that whatever robots like but that's just it. They don't like anything you can't just turn this. On and off we're the process. We are the product. We're the we're the middle point or maybe the endpoint who knows of a of a developmental process of human consciousness that happens within an individual but then with through a whole a whole species and I guess. The computers could do it faster you know because they could do everything faster. But I don't know. I don't know enough about computer science my main iron out the whole worry about ai is just a lot of it seems like backdoor bragging dang. We made these computers too good. We made these robots too good. Medicine show peddler with some like snake venom and cow piss based unguent that's supposed to cure all elements yeah. There is a black I hate to plug black mirror because it's a little on the nose but there's a black mirror episode where a robot a robot guard dog meant to protect a warehouse of goods. is unleashed on people scavenging and and chases them down and kills them and the thing that's wrong with that episode in my opinion is at one point you see Oh wait a minute. No you don't. Apparently. There was originally supposed to be a scene with like the drone operator who's like eating a sandwich and then you know coordinating the actions like like trying to evoke the the removed moral calculus of of drone operators. But I think it's more harrowing and more accurate as like an analysis of the likelihood trajectory of things if there is nobody left to command the robots if if if everything collapses and even the ruling class is destroyed maybe not all of them in person but their ability to like assert social control but like the remnant algorithm-driven machinery of the system continues operating on its own accord and so even the people left are unable to like remake the world because you've got these machines patrolling obsolete property lines. What if the computer was your best friend what if what if your mobile was also your girlfriend ah yeah no that was very good that was a very good felix riff.

Oh my favorite mr. Show sketches I think just for personal enjoyment. I don't think it's the funniest but that's the for me most personally enjoyment is is crime stoppers with or with crime stoppers with jj with ff woody cooks where bob odenkirk plays the guy in the in the barbershop quartet outfit with the giant mustache who tells the story about the aft criminals being thwarted by the crying security guard who you know twist shares a name me and one of the reasons I really love that is not just the great performance by odenkirk but is that growing up in the midwest. I watched on um syndicated tv the same chicago area syndicated crime show that clearly the odinkirks had watched or somebody from the chicago had watched. called tough target with a guy named jj bittenbinder who was a real guy and he dressed like that and he had that mustache and he would tell stories of like of crimes and give tips on how to thwart criminals trying to attack you and when I saw that sketch the first time as a kid. I just was like oh my god. They're doing a f a j bitten binder care parody on hbo and I was street smarts that's it with ff woody cooks. He tore the plant into two pieces bad and worse. You said a crime stick. Those two are a couple of ding-a-lings and apparently I remember.

I watched that I of course I've watched the the all of the ddvd commentaries which rip dvd commentaries. That's the genre that's one of the shortest lived genres of entertainment media. I can imagine because how long did we have those as a thing. Dvd commentaries that they would be like recorded and actually listen to 10 years. Maybe less man like laserdiscs had a better run but anyway so of course. I listened to the dvd commentaries of mr show all four seasons and they described that and yeah they were talking about how they watched that show and they thought he was funny and so they wanted to do a bit about it and they and one of them. I think it was paul. F tomkins described watching the show and there was one bit where he's describing like a really horrible like abduction rape and murder case and he describes the the the the suspects as goofs. He says the two goofs then proceeded to the second location yeah. They were podcasts weren't. They that was the first like podcast god.

I remember the the one of the best. I've ever. I ever watched was the was the. I think step brothers dvd commentary with adam mckay which made me weep with laughter almost as funny as the movie. It was and the bit was is that they brought lou rawls who was recording in the studio on a different set. They brought him in to just talk even though he had no idea anything about the movie or any of it was really funny. I do love. Adam mccabe I'm sorry. The guy has a formative comedic influence even before even before the movies. There was his legendary snl sketches and apparently that I did not know that recorded yesterday that I knew vaguely that richard. Jewell had gone on snl because nor mcdonald of course you know being a anti-government type that he was. He was all over that case and making fun of the fbi and the news media for it up and and he went to new york and he had a little bit with norm but that was the same episode that they did the orange julius sketch. The steven selona stallone episode sylvester that's amazing that was delightful here everything coming together and I i I really think yeah.

There's no way that eastwood wanted to put any of that stuff in the movie because he didn't want to give he didn't want to make like the the media. He didn't want to give them an aw out because isn't that how the media works. It's like they're they're they're totally They're completely feckless with people's lives but then the assumption is if they mess up well. We'll make it up to them. Like oh we ruined this guy's life. He gets to go to new york and meet nor mcdonald. It's fine like that does anything to the horrible horror horrible fact that our government has that power to do that to people. Somebody keeps asking about osilan and murray bushkin. I'll admit. I've never read murray bushkin from what I've read and heard. There isn't really that much and I know that osilan like read boochkin and decided that that the ppk was gonna go from from like ml to communalist.

But the thing is. I don't know what any of that really means in practice. I don't know what any of it actually refers to. I mean according to everything I've read about the way that like the pkk aligned governments in syria operate. It isn't really that com anarchistic and of course you can say well of course not. It's the middle of a war zone but it just doesn't seem like. It's a terribly relevant example of any kind of theory behind it. I don't know maybe. I should read it. I mean the fact it just seems like we're in a completely different situation in the us than anywhere that it would be applicable oh man the cult of the supreme being that's a great one so the jacobins when they took power after the after the In the middle of the french revolution. there was of course a huge anti-catholic sentiment among the leading revolutionaries because the church was viewed as one of the chief upholders of the old regime and that it maintained this superstitious medieval hold on the peasantry. For example that needed to be broken and so there was a significant anti-chris de-christianization campaign in france I mean not just things like the von day where honestly yeah. The infernal columns did a lot of bloody work there and killed people and you know drowned nuns and and priests It gave them republican baptisms by ground drowning them in the loire river and massacring civilians. But it was also a brutal war. On the part of you know the the royal and catholic army. I mean they were hacking people to pieces all the time too but even beyond that there was a concerted effort in certain departments by certain zealous.

 jacobins to persecute priests to you know commit iconoclasm and to try to um break the spell that the catholic church had over the french people to the extent that it still existed and the thing is though that robespierre the the the guy in charge the chief jacobin was well. Of course. He was not a catholic he was abhorrent of the decryptionization campaign because he recognized that virtue does not come from logic alone. Virtue has to come from a some sense. Some ritualized sacralized relationship between citizens and the state the way that the feudal order had between the king the god and and and his subjects because that's where that's where real consent comes from consent can't really just be generated from authoritarianism certainly not at that point given the level of technology. it had to be like socially generated and the way to do that is to have people have a sense of transcendent relationship to something beyond themselves that that the government is a representative of that isn't alien to them and so what robespierre's idea was was to replace catholicism with something. He called the the cult of the supreme being and essentially tried to turn deism into a new catholicism whereby the rituals of religion are paired with a rationalistic appreciation of god as an unmoved mover and nothing else and human affairs as their own and not governed by supernatural actions. It didn't really get off the ground there was really only one festival of the supreme being which robespierre presided over a few months before thermador and his and I think just before his his ultimate.

The last nervous breakdown he had before thermador he kept having nervous breakdowns and being gone for long periods and he had one right before thermador and it was during it that a lot of the the thermadorian coup plotters started making connections and being like hey when he comes back. We don't want to be on that next list of of traitors to the revolution because the funny thing is is that at that point he was going after they like the ideological foes had been and been slain. The the the real war left like was among among like keeping the permanent revolution going was against corruption and the thing is that the revolutionary government was wildly corrupt and a lot of the most corrupt ones who haven't been killed yet thought they might be in the next round of persecutions but anyway so just before that the last like the the high point of the of his of his reign. The high point of the robespiri and reign of terror for him. I think anyway according to to witnesses he was beaming was the festival of the supreme being and it was a procession and there was a big float and it was like a goddess of reason and he was just he was jiving like crazy but it was also a it ended up being one of the things that broke his hold over people because everyone else basically there in the crowd and among the dignitaries was kind of embarrassed and it was essentially a cringe post.

The festival of the supreme being was a huge crim cringe post and the entire group of people was cringing and even though this was still the terror and people's heads were getting cut off for the merest enunciation from a neighbor people were heckling. Robespierre people were telling him to off that's how cringe-inducing it was and that's because you can't do what he wanted to do you can't just say hey you guys you know your socially embedded religious traditions that have you know that are deeper in your minds than and then conscious thought almost because of how how much your life has been shaped by them forget that I got this other stuff. It'll do the same thing though it'll be fine. It's like catholicism catholicism catholicism we've got catholicism at home at home. Some dorky looking paper mache lady in a toga but I will say that I at least give robespierre credit for recognizing that what the de-christianizers wanted to do was a non-starter.

At least at that level of coercive capacity of the state. It was a peasant country and and they didn't have the mechanized ability to suppress the peasantry. The way that the bolsheviks would oh this is good was. It was a period when people started to think the guillotine thing was cringed that's true There were a number of ex of of notable executions at the latter half of the reign of terror that started to clearly turn people. One of them was dantong because downtown was one of the most popular figures of the revolution incredibly. Charismatic well-liked probably guilty of corruption as he had been accused of but he's the guy that people like to point to as the what if what if guy because he seems like he had the capacity to rule of a guy like robespierre but without robespierre's brittle and paranoid nature But oh well he ended up on the wrong and he left paris at the wrong time honestly that didn't help um but that's because you know he knew where his bread was better but anyway the execution of danton was not popular and of course you've got the fact that he was such a baller on the tumble.

His last words were to the to the guy who picks the head. The executioner who then takes the head out of the basket and shows it to the crowd he said make sure the crowd sees it. It's worth a look because he had this incredibly huge head. That was people. People said it was like erotically ugly. He had. He had a big scar on his chin from when he got gored by a bull as a child and he had like pig nose and he was broad a lot of like smallpox scars and he was just still like sexually mesmerizing and incredibly he was a chad. He was an absolute chad whereas robspierre was also unattractive if you've ever seen a buster picture and also poxgard but a little nauseous little dude. They called him the sea green incorruptible because he was always looked like he was going to puke he was wildly unhealthy and his voice was high pitched and tremulous. It was it's kind of amazing that he got where he was. It was because he was the one who he was the most hysterical person during a period of mass hysteria which I like to point out was the fault of the girondins.

It was the fault of the brassoists the guys who go down in liberal history as these innocent victims who wanted a real real liberal revolution that would have given over to the people. you know a a new france with with real liberty and real ability to rise and fall by merit instead of the crazy. blood ritual that it turned into that necessitated then the thermadorian reaction and then finally napoleon but one of the planks of the Because the thing and and there's a lot of reasons that's one is. There wasn't a lot of actual ideological difference between the gerandus and the jacobins. They did not have a lot of policy differences. You could say things like executing the king but there were plenty of gerondus who wanted to execute the king and there were some jacobites that didn't want to execute and a lot of them because they were against the death penalty on principle um. The big thing they were. The difference was is that the the gerondins wanted to declare war on austria. The gerondas wanted to export this liberal revolution across europe and break the chains of feudalism wherever they found them and it was robespierre who said don't do it robespierre.

I said in a I think last week. I said he said the only thing people hate more than a missionary is an armed missionary and at that point pursue and his boys are like that we're going to do it and then it starts going poorly as you could have imagined and that is when the tenor of the whole thing changed because people started to freak out the austrians were going to show up and kill everybody. That's when you have the september massacres and then that inevitably is going to lead to the people who who seize that moment of fear most efficiently most effectively. Are the ones who are going to take power and that was the the gang of hysterics sean zeus and and um and robespierre and the guy in the wheelchair.

 somebody wanted a little background on what I was saying is that I'm sorry. I said for a while before because in the french revolution. After the king is finally deposed. You had factions within the the the the national assembly and the for the ruling faction that executed the king was called the girondis. They were all named after the places that they held meetings and they were all they were usually named after one or another medieval order that owned the monastery. They stayed in and he had the jarondis and the other jacobins also known as the mountain who were on the left wing of the chamber and stood up at the back and eventually after after the ruling gerandins went to war with austria and it up. The jacobins took power and started chopping everybody's heads off but then the war started going well. The tide of hysteria went away and what was left was people who saw a bunch of weirdos trying to build new religions in the middle of 

 piles of cow manure on the plas de vendome and said let's get rid of these guys which then led to the directory which is such an amazing government. When you look at it. It was purely cynical. I mean it was made up of the most cynical members of the revolutionary leadership. The ones who had survived until that point the only way you'd survive until thermador is if you didn't have any principles because if you had any principles you either got out of government or you got killed and so they just spent five years going playing whack-a-mole with the left and the right while ruling from the center in a completely from a hollow center which is essentially where we are now.

The difference is that we don't yet have a situation of like crisis and failure state capacity whereby like the masses are genuine threat because the the the whoever was ruling in paris on a day-to-day basis depended essentially on who could get as many people who could get as most people in a place at one time who can bring as many people to the front of a palace. At this. At the same time. They generally had the run of the city which is not the case anymore and that's what necessitated napoleon. But the thing is is that napoleon was was. The process was the product of the revolution right. He was. He was a minor noble but I put so minor that he never would have been in a position of power within the military. He wouldn't have been a general in the in the ashant regime like the revolution gave him both the the social freedom to move at his own talent but also the the field where he could express those talents constant war with the rest of europe what do we got now.

 meritocracy has been replaced by this because of course and this is inevitable. This is why meritocracy is a lie because even if you start off from a meritocratic position of pure equality and let everybody go as soon as those distributions of resources are fixed and they're not replaced as long as you're not doing like a bakun. In 100 estate tax. Nobody gets to send any money to their kids at all and honestly even if you did that because they're still social position and like just early childhood development and access to more's values. Social connections beyond money that would render even clawing back from meritocracy over time render it less but now in our country. It's going to the time is going to be much shorter because there's barely any clawback. like it's almost impossible to lose a fortune in this country because almost all is kept intact because that's how our system is designed to work and so it's it's now even that early meritocracy is burned out completely and it's just reproducing an elite copies and copies on copies like like in multiplicity. And we are like the 15th michael. Keaton at this point copied off of the 14th michael keaton who was copied off the 13th michael keaton and then what is their experience get push shuffling papers around in a series of absolutely unwinnable wars that aren't even designed to be won.

They're designed to be had just like our arguments on the colonial wars. They are there to be had. They're there to chew up time and resources. They're not there to achieve objectives so I mean napoleon was waiting for an army that was fighting for its life. His first big success was fighting against an internal insurgency. The city of tulun which had separated after the seizure power of the jacobins had seceded from france and taken english help and was being besieged for months by the french army and had to be had and had to be seat taken by thanks almost single-handedly napoleon's wiles if there's a if there's a tulum now if there's a tulu now you're not supposed to take it. You're just supposed to stay in the lines you're supposed to be. There. You're supposed to chew up time and resources you're supposed to be a place on a budget line for more. armored personnel carriers and and small arms and and missiles and drones to go you're not supposed to do anything and then after that napoleon he marches and he goes into italy and just single-handedly wipes out the austrian forces there you're not supposed to do that you couldn't do it if you wanted to for one thing because there isn't any army that we can fight that way and even though and that's how we're what we're designed to do. But the enemies we do fight. We're not supposed to beat there's no napoleon no the all the system the syst the the the explosion of of possibility the society inferment turmoil and and from that growth that revolutionary france was we're we're we're absolutely in the opposite situation where all of our social conditions are only driving us closer and closer to to this apocalyptic stasis because there's no one with the will or ability to push against the algorithm. They're just going to let it re reduce everything down to its component profit until there's just a little pile of bones and that's it and of course you know if everything does collapse and then.

I don't think that's going to happen. I that would not be an environment that's going to create dynamic. It's not going to select for talent let's just say that apparently it's clear on the west coast now which is nice. The fires are kind of down are the fires not on at all how how more fire on fire how much more on fire is california than it was a week ago. Fifty percent more or fifty s fifty percent is on fire. Thirty percent is on fire a hundred percent as on fire 120 percent is on fire.

I have no idea because you only hear the story at first and then at some point you just sort of assume well. It took itself took care of itself. It's another people are telling me. It's not clear at all. All right well never mind. It was all orange. I guess. It was a little orange the other night but I don't.

I don't really. I don't think that I observed much in the way of west coast smoke and haze yosemite mega eruption of a volcano in 2020. We should be so lucky wouldn't that kind of solve global wouldn't that solve climate change right because it would call like it would cause a catastrophic cooling right and it would also probably reduce co2 emissions really drastically very quickly. I wouldn't kill everybody. It wouldn't even it wouldn't even. I don't even think it would kill everybody in north america right depending on how big the explosion was of course.

I haven't seen all of bang zheng ho's movies. I really liked snow piercer because it was very hard on its sleeve allegory which I really like. I told you guys how much I love mother. I feel like if i. I feel like there's this idea that if the metaphor in your movie isn't subtle it's not good and I just don't think that's true. It's all about what you're doing with it. What you're trying to express with it and there are plenty of ways that a very heavy-handed metaphor can work with other elements of the story. You're trying to tell to make a good movie subtlety on itself just because what that is is that essentially says a good movie.

An artistic movie is one that one that certain people are able to discern right not everybody not for everybody. Because most people are dumb. It takes a certain type of iq a smartness if you will to be able to discern what's being said and that that makes a good movie and I don't think that's what art is anyway. I mean that's a way to critically analyze movies. I think and it's a useful way because there are ways that subtlety of metaphor can in certain situations be an expression of a greater like narrative narrative ingenuity or like a formal statement. But I think that that what it really is is about it. It's about feeling something that you can't explain you should be able to explain it to some degree to other people but there should be a really great art. There's a certain part of its appeal that will always be outside of your ability. To express you can feel it and maybe you can kind of get it but you can't really translate it to other people. It's it's ineffable if you can pin down the value like oh here's the metaphor and here's what it means and here's what it says about trump or whatever the. I think well all right. That's a schematic for this piece of art but like the soul is somewhere else.

And I think that's one of the really negative impacts of the recap culture that helped create the prestige tv moment that like reinforced the tropes and basically and told creators what they wanted to see and what they were to respond to is that a lot of these shows even the good ones they feel like they a lot of the elements in them exist explicit you can kind of see the seams you can see where oh this is for the critics to point out. This is for someone to recap this and then they can create a pat explanation for what this episode means that's going to be deeper than the message of an episode of csi miami right. It's going to say more about the human condition but it's still mechanistic. It's it's still it's still craft. It's not art. I think the show the show that always gets me with that. The most is fargo which I think is very good. But I think the parts of it that aren't good are the parts where I can see oh. This is for the critics. I think I'm i. I wasn't going to watch devil all the time because it's two hours and it's a bunch of like british public school boys and short pants pretending to be hillbillies which is very tiresome to me. But our pats is going ham again. Might have to watch it although I really do not like his performance in the rover that a lot of people like and that seems like kind of a that seems like a defining wacky rock patents or like committed patents and performance and if you don't like that. I don't. I don't know maybe. I won't like him in that either oh and that reminds me. So this is one thing. I wanted to talk about for a while and I'll end with this in the in the context of talking about like the new critical understanding of television specifically. no no not just television all art. But specifically the narrative art forms television and movies. The stuff that we've convinced ourselves is where all the horrors of this country originate not a reflection of them.

But that's what we get. We are all we're all typical. Now. We're all pmrc people. We all believe that what we get out of culture is what we then do. We believe that. I think there's no other under there's no other way to understand the way people talk about art now. In exclusively political terms. Why would that be the only thing you cared about unless it had some sort of significant impact on your life. It's like really really getting into the score and only talking about score if that was the only thing anybody talked about in movies. People would be like what's going on why what's with the score thing and like maybe that would be a weird like that would probably have some sort of material explanation too but it would be a different one. I think the answer for why we do it now is because we desperately want to think that this thing that is all we absorb. All day. Spectacle has to be the seat of meaning and the seat of change because we can't imagine anything else. We can't imagine the real world anymore being a place where we do anything else but and reenact the.

We saw on the internet which is where we really live and the stuff we see in media and that has created a a new sort of critical artistic taylorism where or or positivism. I'm not. I'm not sure which word specifically to use essentially what I'm saying is that we've replaced evaluating art narrative art. We have replaced evaluating narrative art as a complex artistic at enterprise with varying elements within it that we are going to evaluate for them and then see how they operate together to make a greater a greater thing a thing greater than some of its parts. That's what art is you've got these parts if it's good art. There's something that comes out above them something that comes and emanates from them. If it's shitty art. It's just the things now art is a purely commercial or it's a purely propagandistic product and the only metric is good content bad content as in stuff that will make people act good versus stuff that'll act make people act bad good ideas bad ideas and then watching.

Something is just clicking like an umpire or one of those you just wait and see okay how many we got now all right. We got 15 good things and 13 bad things. This is a good movie. We got 17 good things and 12 bad things that's a good movie. We got four good things and nine 90 bad things. This movie we have to drag and actually you know what people shouldn't see it and if they do they're bad people and I think the reason for that is not. It's not malevolent people aren't doing it because they're becoming like hysterical philistines because of sjw ism. It's because there's no there's nothing else in movies.

The art part is being drained out of them because capital is totally overwhelming them the artistic ex. The artistic impulse that has to be part and parcel to any artistic endeavor is in these commercialized art forms almost gone. It's been diluted to parts per million and now that doesn't mean there still isn't great art. But it's just harder to find and it's more concentrated and the average piece of art has less of it than it used to think of blockbusters that nobody would say are great art or shouldn't. Say are great art from the 80s versus blockbusters of today and then remember the fact that that is even more hegemonic like blockbusters are a larger percentage of our of our of our movie diet and tv is larger percentage which is a more adulterated life art form than film.

Everything is just being drained of art so what is left what can we talk about well. You can talk about like individual elements like but that's essentially arguing about whether a hot dog is a sandwich. It's boring It's brittle talking about the political element that invests it with emotion the emotion that we couldn't feel for it anymore because it's bad art. The emotion that we feel for art that comes from a connection to it has been replaced with a connection of an emotional connection related to our political beliefs because we can find it there. It's the only thing left in it that we can resonate with art emotionally anything else that we would resonate with is gone. So we have to recreate what art is and turn it into this propaganda exercise where the good and bad are pure just objective tallies within the movie which means we don't have to think about it.

We don't have to express our discontent about it. We can we can it's essentially a mec way to cope with our closing historical Our our closing artistic horizons is because as the like the the the edges come in you know and as it as as as there's less good stuff. More bad stuff bad stuff is worse good stuff isn't as good and there isn't those aren't those high p points and there isn't even that basic level of engagement and satisfaction that creates discontent. Like this. It is our opium not in a bad sense but in the 19th century sense as a medicine as palliative care for like getting a bullet pulled out of your. We're in it capital realism baby so we have to accept the shitty stuff as our only sucker and therefore decide that the artistic value is the political value because nothing else is worth looking for or could be found and that and part of that process is that as we put more and more of our politics into our cultural diet. Our politics become more of a entertainment too like as entertainment gets more political politics get more entertaining and now because we care about things. We watch as a level of politics like we watch our art to get a jolt of either righteous rage or or vindication. We get it from our art and we also get it from watching the news or scrolling. Our twitter feed or going to facebook to post a meme. It's all the same. It's been flattened because in the same way that art has been drained out of our art. Politics has been drained out of our politics. Politics is similarly denatured of any any in this case. The art the place of art would be accountability to actual citizens of this country. It's being adulterated out and denatured and replaced with spectacle and our emotional investment in the spectacle of it who the good guys are are winning yay.

The bad guys are winning boo and that is why people arguing about what whether it's moral to vote for biden. It's like my god you're just you're you are gnawing your own flesh. How do you not see that this is a completely sterile argument that is just like if batman could beat the terminator and serves the same purpose to waste time to just go around in circles to give you a jolt every day up until the big jolt. The big game the election day and then there's a come down and then you're like okay that was intense and then you get a refractory period but then as things keep getting worse and we need more and more of that opium we need more of that balm and gilead to get through the day. What's this oh. We get to go back to the top of the goddamn drop at the cyclone ah until the next election. That's the exact same. It's all part of one continuous process of self-amusement in the face of armageddon and personal alienation to the point of of of misery of mass death. I mean huge huge huge rage raise of suicides drug overdoses people are just checking the out depression they're checking out because none of this is enough anymore but the people who are still able to function are putting more and more into this because it's the only button they have. It's the only button they can press. It's the morphine drip in the hospital. It's the hospice morphine drip hitting it over and over again. Every time. We're arguing about biden every time you're going to watch and see if tenet is 

You know is more dude bro than interstellar. they're talking talk about whether like there's sufficient intersectionality in the green new deal or in the marvel cinematic universe you're hitting the goddamn morphine. The non-engaged are people who are get their get their opium elsewhere. A lot of them get it in the form of actual opium or at this point fentanyl which is the which is the like tick-tock of of morphine or whatever if you want to talk about like the accelerated endpoint of this thing. Like trump is the fentanyl of polit. Politics is theater like black. Panther is the pinnacle of like politics as culture. and fentanyl is the fentanyl of just trying not to feel the pain of living and other ones just personal drama or they're just trying to survive and and and their their their Opium comes in the form of the relief that they're still able to keep their head above water for another day and they're not even thinking about any of this. And like all of these are the worst most deadly most refined artificial capital processed versions of this generalized cultural need to soothe the pains of exploitation through through some sort of ritualized consensus and I would say don't do that don't do don't do that one either my god.

All these need to be a shoot. we have to confront the pain of our our alienation and instead of seeing how hard it will be to change and say oh well better. Flee towards pleasure recognize that that pleasure will never be enough. That pleasure will always be just beyond one's grasp and it will always leave you maddened with thirst and that the only way forward for yourself is to confront the pain and try to transform it try to change your relationship to the pain and that's the beginning of spirituality. I think because you don't because spirituality is what you is what allows you to live in the absence of this and allows you to live in the absence of hope that you can get things better in your life in a in a material way because that's not going to happen someone just said I love to comb man that's gross.

I'd say it gets worse but it gets better how about that and that the fate of any human and the fate of the species is how many people and when break or what time you break. One way or the other should I try and leave the states or stay at fight. You can't man. We're they're we're in here for good. They won't let us out can you believe it the only way out is through the best way. I can kind of condense everything into because a lot of what I talk about on here is about how how captured we feel how trapped.

We feel how out of options how how how hobson's choiced we are and it's true but the implication of that should not be some sort of pathetic nihilism that just ends up being more self-absorption more consumption more hollow vapidness. It's just from like one more removal of irony or try to conquer them and that's by not finding the false wall. That seems that of the of the walls that are enclosing. One of them is false and you have to find the one that's false as in what are you worrying about what is causing you pain what is making your life miserable that doesn't have to like that you are essentially in some way or another choosing to make work choosing to project there because the the wanting you have is so powerful. The want you feel is so intense that it projects this wall and that if you would confront that want and find that maybe you don't need that thing then that wall disappears and you can move. But I don't know what it is. It's. It's for everyone else every individual and that's what's so maddening and terrifying about this moment is it's going to come down a lot of it to how many people are able to just sit to sit with themselves long enough to and knock and feel and find the false wall all right.

Maybe. I'll answer one question and I'll peace out the funniest. I'll leave on this the funniest president other than trump all right you got to go with when they are president. So they're funny presidency man. They really aren't very funny as a group. Nixon's pretty funny obviously just because of the face and the noise and the voice and and all that I guess taft because he was fat got stuck in a bathtub that's classic hijinks and when you consider how much comedy back then revolved around like a fat guy getting into hijinks. It was essentially like hardy from laurel and hardy was president. I have to say though people make fun of taft for getting stuck in the bathtub. I'm pretty sure that if I tried to just go in the bathtub that he got stuck in. I'd get stuck in it because he looks like a big fat guy in the pictures and he's remembered as the fattest president. But he was like 300 pounds which in modern context of america is not that big and he was tall so those bathtubs were made for people who were much smaller. So if I got in that exact bathtub. I'd probably get my ass stuck in it. All right guys see ya bye.
