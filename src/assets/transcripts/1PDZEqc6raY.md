In the shuffling madness and down down the locomotive breath let the all-time loser head long to his death. Host. I already did that on host what is going on here okay we gotta cancel you feel the piston scraping scraping off his brow. Thank god. He saw the handles cause the train won't stop going though it could slow down yeah yeah. You hear the silence jumping angels as they fall a woman and his best friend in bed and having fun always going down the corridor on his hands and knees. I sold charlie he stole the handle and the trainer won't stop going though it could slow down yeah. Yeah. Flute solo you know how it goes you know you know jeff rotol. You know tol you know about the flute solo. You know how it goes you can sing it yourself do. I sound okay does does it sound all right had problems yesterday. Apparently it was a little tinny. I don't know what that is something with the internet someone asked. This is actually a very good question to start with somebody asked if I have trot brain am I a trot at the heart of it and you know what having certainly after having read deutsche biography of trotsky. I absolutely feel like at a certain level. I have to take the claim because I really do feel like. Trotsky is the lens that everyone looks back at history with which is not in a position of action but in a position of observation and that is why he refused to ever really choose between contradictory courses of action where one thing had to happen but at the cost of something else and couldn't resolve them because they were too detached from them. But I res.

I but the thing that paralyzes him is not so much lack of investment. He's very invested. It's that he is always seeking the transcendence of the conflict. He's always seeking the third pole that should historically be doing the work of resolving these problems that is why he took the riddle of how to be a convinced marxist in russia which was a feudal backwater being integrated into capitalism as an essential. A medieval country having capitalism thrust on it. You still have to like if you are a marxist and you believe and marxism is the belief that replaced christianity at like within the the liberal cosmology that followed the death of god as well. It had to something has to fill that gap and marxism was good but how do you live by its tenants. Its its guiding principles in a situation where you do not have a revolutionary role to play you only know about this stuff because of what happened in europe the development you seek has to come through capitalism not through a revolution from above which it would have to be because of the unorganized nature of the peasant masses. The mature communism is about building a a self-conscious class into a majority through conflict with capitalism not through conflict with the communist directed industrial economy and none of them. None of those bolsheviks would have gone through with 1917 if they thought they would have had to have done that they were assuming because they were all listening to trotsky some intervention in the form of a a european-led global revolution that would start in germany and there was a period there in 1918.

Specifically when those thought they were right. They thought it was all coming together. They were just even though the whole country was falling apart. They were in the middle of a civil war and they were doing brutal violence. They felt like oh my god. This shit's coming together because of the the german revolution of 1918 and the like the strikes in in throughout german cities throughout 1919. But the tide rolled back and then when russia was defeated on the field of battle in the in the soviet polish war which hilariously you could blame on stalin and people have blamed on stalin for not deriving his forces directly towards warsaw. When that tide rolled back new conditions. Observed and people had to decide okay what are we what are we more committed to the marxist project. The socialist project or my place in it what are we more protective of and that was the conflict that defined the question of how to deal with the peasantry because in my mind bukharin had the right of it the bourgeois could not defend itself. In 1917 it would have been overwhelmed by counter-revolution from the reactionary feudal overlords would have happened. They were not there the only part of the of the of the political structure of the class structure in the cities. Was and saint petersburg specifically was the the bolshevik party and so of course the people who ended up winning that question about what to do with the peasants were those who said collective eyes at the point of a gun because that was the way to save their position within this new new world. They made and their conviction that they were right. They were historically vindicated which is the thing they cared about more than anything and trotsky was paralyzed by the question. He wanted industrialization but he did not want what it would have required and so he sought the revolution. He was perpetually seeking the third thing that would and according to marxism should eventually emerge. It's a global revolution which is like supposed to be on its way and so that puts them in a position.

The trot at heart of being horrified by the prospect of actually holding power because they can only imagine holding power as moral like personal moral. Decrepitude personal violation and so like the posit the trotskyist is the person who flees from power because they don't want the responsibilities it entails because they don't have their conviction is of something that is not in the moment they're not convinced. They're not convinced but how could you ever be convinced and so you will always flee from power and that's why you gotta split in every five minutes because you have to flee from power and its responsibilities even the responsibility of supporting other countries that oppose the united states in some abstract sense that doesn't even matter in your day-to-day life because you're in the imperial court who the cares what you have to say about another country well. How is this the most important thing in the world that you've weighed the heart of this foreign foreign government against a feather and found it wanting like there's a context but the the the idea of appealing to the other to rise up instead of asserting power is I say. I would say the the default state of leftists in the west. Since the fall of the soviet union essentially everybody is atrocious once the soviet union ends and the people who like cling crazily to supporting the soviet union in the history or current communist regimes no matter what they do like china They're doing that because they have they're trying to deny their essential trotskyism. They're trying to deny their phobia of power because of the futility of it and so you can hold off and hold a position where the only political formation you can really support is one made up of people of perfectly like mind because that's all it is it's mind.

There is no material interest binding any of these people any of us. We are not members of a class of of a labor class in relation to a means of production. We are consumers first and foremost and so we cannot imagine. We cannot conceive of power and so its most abstract expression of violence is abhorrent to us because it's theoretical and so everybody is a trot. Everybody is either embracing it and going ham sectarian style and denouncing every other every non-american regime that does anything that they wouldn't do in a platonic ideal of a socialist system that his nep that could not exist in the current moment because of the persistence of capitalism and so even as we come together in what we think is an imitation of mass politics. On the left. We're really just a bunch of trots bringing together our splinter groups until they start fracturing again and that will persist until there is a genuinely materially fixed working class socialist movement in this country. Forget working class like. I said that's a meaningful phrase now just people organizing not on not in political parties not in interest groups not in a third like pressure groups but as workers and building connections to other people that are like politically infused but socially dense that are forged by mutual experience and that define our action out of the clouds and into reality where a lot of the seat of the questions that seem paralyzing from the heights are clarified because a lot of them don't even come up because we're all arguing about things that are theoretical we're arguing about conditions of what would who would I let my movement. There is no movement you are asking these questions to have these questions to ask you are fleeing from power.

The very prospect of it which begins with submission which begins with submission of time and energy submitting to others will and the decision of what to do with your time when you're not being compensated for it. When compensation is the sole mode of drive that we have built into our our our social feedback like what we know the only way we the market defines all in all actions that we then like associate with being productive like if we're not being paid for it. It doesn't feel like real we don't feel truly motivated to do it. That is the libertarian thesis and it is what they try to turn us into and we're pushing against that we're swimming again upstream at every moment trying to pull together in the face of that because the work that needs to be done is not going to be remunerated or remunerated. However the head above water very few of us think of us ourselves as having time to spend not keeping a roof over our head when things are so. Goddamn scary and precarity is all you feel so. It's a lot to ask people to do work that's not going to be immediately pleasurable or compensated for and what's going to make them do that is not an idea. It is not a theory it is not a side. It is a shared interest with others that can then take that fire hose of of selfishness and fear and direct it oh.

[17:44](https://youtu.be/1PDZEqc6raY?t=17m44s)

I don't have to just be anxious about this oh. I don't have to just be angry because other people who know what I'm going through who are not compete who are not com who are not condescending to us from a cultural height which is very much what the online left is by definition. This is true of all cultural expressions like it doesn't mean that there isn't it isn't necessary and it doesn't mean that ideas that end up by percolating into grassroots work don't start there or aren't rather. I should say communicated there but there is a barrier there especially since a lot of the things that these people talk about me included are not relevant to people's direct strategic and tactical questions. Those strategic tactical questions are only answerable at at the point of experience. We are all uniquely alienated. We do not have a shared language of alienation that is perfect and the word language is the most important part there because when we say we experience we all get we are all mutually alienated by capitalism. But we experience that alienation differently. It means we have different words to describe that feeling that we use to for ourselves and among ourselves and that means that we build and forge definitions of terms in our intimate relationships.

Now that now the terms we're talking about are are brought down from a cultural firmament. All the expressions and language of culture and politics that we share we are having imposed on us not from around ours from those around us. But from this this colder cultural superstructure but the definitions of those words the inflections the the unspoken shared emotional connotations of the words are forged into are forged not on the internet and we all still have some social life and even if it's more impoverished than it used to that's still where we get our definitions and so the sterility of a post-working-class politics or post-class politics at all in america is that when we feel this alienation we have this huge gap between what these words are used as currency in the culture and what we what we think the words mean. And that means that when we're picking and choosing the words to describe our exploitation and misery we are not reproducing a relationship between like our material conditions and what we blame for it. But we're picking from this gumbo. This cosmic gumbo of you well of ideas that are coming from above and that don't relate to my direct experience because there is no working class counter hegemani to express cultural ideas.

This is what grouch this is essentially gramsci's entire conception of how this works is that you you do not get a working class that can vie for power with capital through just organizing at the base. What happens is that through organizing on the base you create cultural institutions that do not answer the capital that are generated from The collective will the decisions of these people that are made outside of considerations of profit and compensation. They're doing this as it were for free and it's the degree to which they will do things for free that gives them the power to act as a social organism against capitalism. I could draw this as a graph. I swear to god and the and that used to be in this country. There was a working class that had a organized structural pathways to power that gave it corresponding cultural influence and political influence in the form of its veto control over domestic policy in the democratic party on on many issues that were negotiated over the course of the of the early cold war and that was generated by this connection. This this thing that connected grassroots people working in factories with union organizations that then confederated and then had relationships to a political party that was infested at every level and and staffed at every level with people moving through this with capillary motion through this machine and then getting into positions of authority within cultural creators and and policies that were directly associated with maintaining the structures of of working class expression.

Now the thing that a lot of people miss about this arrangement is that you don't get to a point. I don't think anyway where capitalism is essentially culturally overwhelmed in this way. The way that the revisionists would imagine the point of this the the point of creating this structure or the point that the rather I should say this the purpose. This structure serves in generating revolutionary potential is that you have people who are self-aware as workers and there are more of them over time and they make up a bigger percentage of the of the unorganized masses so that when a crisis of capitalism comes that cannot be negotiated that can no longer be negotiated you are now negotiating terms of surrender. They will go to war. They will go to war. They will not sign terms of surrender without seeing how it goes on the battlefield. We've seen that time and again there is a limit to the reform that any system can take and then either Two things historically have happened either the ground collapses under the feet of the ruling class before they can declare war like in the french revolution or They declare war and usually honestly win because the working class isn't ready and I would argue that there were several points that called for the that strategically called for the working class to be ready to go to war and I would say that obviously the big one was 1914 but the the the work of creating a transnational working class had not it did not happen. It needed longer it needed longer who knows under stable conditions how how long it would have taken for solidarity in europe among internet. Working class parties across national lines to overcome nationalism.

I think it would have happened eventually but world war one happened and they weren't strong enough to stop it or risk their positions and so and then of course after world war one and the russian revolution you have another moment of conflict after world war. Ii is a huge moment when stalin backed down and you can say that he had to but again he had to do it to save the soviet union but that's not the soviet union is a vessel. The soviet union is a care about our immediate power maintenance of power. But you could argue that the the conditions meant we would have lost and so we stood down and that that fight by the way extended to the united states where there was a huge explosion of strikes immediately after world war. Ii the biggest strike wave in american history at that point and this was in conditions of you know relative prosperity following the great depression. But all labor conflict had been muzzled during the war and there had been the popular front with the soviets and so a lot of the most militant workers in america were convinced that they were getting ready for a push after the soviet nazis were defeated to confront capitalism in alliance with the soviet union either overtly or you know as sort of a situation where the united states and and the soviet union agreed to a sort of leveraged buyout of each other after world war ii and that they could coordinate that from below through their mobilization within labor unions.

 these are the cio communists and such and there was a huge huge. Strike wave part of the strike wave involved harry truman nationalizing or trying to nationalize the steel industry until the supreme court told him no but of course. Unlike jackson he obeyed that time and that wave broke and with it came a counter reaction from capital in the form of mccarthyism and the red scare which was used to root out the real motivated people who will do for free core of the labor movement and replacing it with people who were gonna do way less for free and with that taft-hartley which is a stake in the heart of the labor movement absent just as a self-preserving bureaucracy and and and mechanism for patronage distribution short of ideology Just as part of like the the organ system of capitalism. It also killed that too the red scare and tapped hartley killed the body and soul of the american labor movement of course. Nobody knew it at the time they thought okay. We'll get them next time but next time was the 70s and at that point the working class had been so thoroughly castrated of any kind of ideology or political vitality that when it came time to restructure the deal essentially between peop workers and capital have been struck after world war ii. There were no actual working-class interests at the table.

[30:00](https://youtu.be/1PDZEqc6raY?t=30m00s)

There were only bureaucrats. There were only bureaucrats of structures who were totally adhered to the state and had loyalty to the state. Not to the working class. We've been living in the aftermath of that ever since and what that means is that there is no there is no counter hegemony. There is no left-wing counter-hegemony. There is a leftist strain within culture but as part of the broader liberal capitalist realist milieu. A new left must be built through struggle.

I think that's the first principle that's the first principle I operate from and people wonder how the hell can get. People get mad at the government and feel alienated from the government because they have to pay taxes and they feel like that's oppression or that the government tells them that they have to wear a seat belt or or they have to wear a mask that's oppression. But their boss can tell them you know how much time off they can have when they can take a piss you know what they can eat for lunch. Whatever the hell. They can determine the the vast majority of their life and they don't see them as their enemy and it's because they're the ones who pay them and in a culture that is purely and fully from the point of view of capital that is that is constructed from the milwaukee and eye of capital at least the head.

The stuff that we all react to the same way the parties concentrate this and then we all react to it and and and revolve around it. But the main the big stuff that everybody sees not the little stuff that micro sex see is hegemonically liberal. There's no counter culture counter current within it and so we can only operate as as self-interested units and that means that even though we're all experiencing capitalist exploitation and alienation more keenly every day because the most direct expression of that is compensated for with money we are paid for it. It doesn't feel that bad and so consequently we vent our alienation at everything except the cause of it because the cause of it has been compensated for and if it's not enough money. That's really your fault for not hustling hard enough for not having gotten the right degree for not standing up to your boss and asking for a raise. It's your fault you're not having enough money. There there is like a god-like dispenser of value because value is determined in the market. Value is determined in the market and we absorb that and then we operate from those assumptions and that colors our entire approach to politics. Our entire conception of ourselves as citizens as political subjects and it means the class is washed. Away. Class is not perceptible in our expression. Our language can't pick it up.

There is an article in harper's about the bessemer alabama amazon warehouse um union drive and they followed this young guy who worked who worked as amazon. He was a young african-american guy. He worked there and he was a self-described like entrepreneur like he thought of working at amazon as a stepping stone and he thought that you he was going to end up selling to amazon. He was going to have his own cosmetics company and then he was going to be a partner of amazon. He identified with amazon and if he didn't make money he felt ashamed if he if his thing wasn't going to succeed he would have felt ashamed he would have because it's god and so he didn't want a union because the amazon amazon told him and the only people in the neighbor in the the majority of people in the plant in the factory that wanted or the fulfillment center that wanted a union where the old people who remember when unions union jobs existed in the steel industry there before it went away. Their kids don't have those memories. They don't have that experience of sharing grievances against the person giving you money the person giving you money has their entire life been the dispenser of value in every element of society and in your soul and now that doesn't mean we're all doomed to it. But it's what you have to fight against and you have to assume that we're in a condition of prostrate institutions and since crisis is accelerating.

[35:59](https://youtu.be/1PDZEqc6raY?t=35m59s)

I would say that crisis is accelerating pretty rapidly even if it doesn't always feel that way that the the dispenser basically is going to disrupt our expectations enough to bring us sort of out of a trance bring us more into the moment of our lives bring us more urgently into connection with each other over these crisis conditions what do we do what do we do. At the end of the day you can only ask the computer what do. We do so much because they don't know because they're asked. We're all just asking and then our ask our us asking the question just bounces off each other and then we pretend that that's an answer you gotta you ask yourself or you ask each other and then you act and again. This is not to blame anyone like one of the big things that makes it so hard to communicate. Because of this is the emotional content of these terms and in the absence of material interests all politics as we experience it through media social or otherwise is moral.

It's all moralizing it's all moralizing. It can only be a moral question because there is no material dimension as I said that is all getting steamed off through self-loathing in the market and so if questions are moral questions. Only then holding positions is of um. Holding positions on anything is a moral act having opinions becomes the only moral act because it's the only public one. It's the only one that we enact and so that means that these questions become totally colored and our ability to answer them. Throws goes out the window because we're defending our very self-conception as virtuous people which is all we have and the thing about marxism and this is forgotten because we just can't process. It is that marx was a moral deflationist. Unlike all the other socialist leaders who were emerging and thinkers who were starting to to write opposed to capitalism in the mid 19th century. Marx did not object to capitalism on moral grounds.

This is very important to understand. Marx was not saying that that the exploitation of capitalism was evil and the capitalists were evil because they did it which is different than all. The other utopian socialists and christian socialists and anarchists of the period defined it to him. Capitalists were acting out their historic role in disrupting the feudal order and creating the conditions for a self-aware working class to emerge which would then act in their collective self-interest which would abolish bourgeois morality and would abolish all of the petty questions of of good and bad that consume us and consume our and make us neurotic with doubt about our ourselves. Oh. Is it moral to steal a loaf of bread to feed your family well nobody's needs to feed. Nobody's everybody gets bread. Everybody gets bred you don't have to worry about it all. These all these questions become meaningless. These questions that we fixate over if we can push through and so marx was more marx was morally deflationary. He wanted people to think of politics less about morality. He was a is an opposed to rousseau.

He wanted it to be thought of not that way so that you could view every situation dispassionately so that you could view the contours before you with a clear eye and because we live in a post working post-class culture. We live in a post-class society in a real meaningful sense. Not that there isn't class exploitation but that it is no longer processed as such and therefore like the culture does not have within it the strands. The the the the expression of a working-class culture that's gone and with it is anything other than a moral basis for politics so all of us even marxists even people who believe in their bones that that everything mark said about about the dialectic of history and materialism is true. They still argue even if they don't know it on moral grounds and invest these questions with moral import and like if you want to understand the culture war as it is and the liberal cr ratchet towards a more and more strident multiculturalism. The that the post left always talks about as though it's a conspiracy between raytheon and bank of america. It is not.

It is the subconscious collective spasm of conscience of the urban liberal class. These are people who are in a system with a benefit from exploitation and misery where they get to live lives of unalienation unalienated labor that is alienated by their guilt that is motivated by their guilt and that guilt must be excreted somehow and that is where the the moral grandstanding and and bidding up come from and moral inflation and that means that more and more liberals as as conditions get worse as as anxiety and politicization of culture become more and and the urge to change something becomes more felt by people even if they can't articulate why they have to express it and if you feel even if you are not even if you are being exploited even if you are a working cl. Per a worker.

Even if you are precarious you still feel guilty because you have conditioned yourself to view the world through a lens whereby the world things aren't fair and it's capitalism's fault but you're still benefiting from it in your mind because of the cultural because of your cultural expectations. It's not about any actual class position. It's your cultural expectations and it is people almost. It is almost exclusively people who are feel guilty who are making the decisions about where the contours of the culture war should go both what politicians should say opinion makers online in social media people in trying to make a a job out of it like racial rainmakers and then even at the very top you've got very guilty liberal billionaires because this is this this thing has absorbed everybody. It's declassed everybody including the rich the rich are being declassed. The rich are being lumpinonized but of course. Capitalism doesn't need them to be class oriented to orient to for capitalism to work to their benefit because it is a machine of extracting profit and pushing it upward and even if the people who it's being given to are horrified by the machine and would like to stop it.

[44:48](https://youtu.be/1PDZEqc6raY?t=44m48s)

They can't and so they figure out explanations in their head for why they should still have all that money. Even though it's being wrought by this horror and the answer liberals come to is well. You know. It's the racism. It's the racism. It's. It's white maleness. We gotta defeat that which is of course most like they're. It's a white male paradigm. They're just trying to extract that part of themselves that feels guilty and then extrovergate that guilt through cathartic destruction of the other and then on the right conservatives. Think oh it's It's the blacks fault. It's It's non-hierarchy's fault basically because black people form in the united states. This other this racial other that is not fully within citizenship and that is the escape valve for class conflict within the american polity always has been that's why fundamentally northern capitalism could not accede to the end of the s racial caste system in the south. After the civil war. It couldn't do it because it would have destabilized the the uneasy data that was currently existing between workers small holders and capital.

It might have tipped things in the direction of class war class conflict because my god what if the poor whites and the poor blacks get together after the civil war what if they what if they compare notes they will be in an unbeatable position. They will have leverage that will be undefeatable by by the the shabby trappings of post-war american capitalism that had not yet turned into the mighty dynamo that would conquer the world and so that racial caste system is at the basis of american capitalism not as the founder. The foundation which is what and I think that literally is where a lot of the confusion comes from is once again. This is moralism creeping into objective questions. It morally feels right to think because you get to talk about it. In these terms that are amenable to the discourse and amenable to politics which is racial. We can monkey around with that stuff. We can't do anything about capitalism. We can monkey around with the order of hierarchy and who gets to get in and who gets to go out. We can diversify our ruling class. We have that option but we have to not be You know moral. We have to be morally committed to that. Now racism gets built in it gets. It gets deeper than any other experience so for a lot of right wingers yeah throughout history. They have been motivated in their mind by racism even though that racism is built on top of this machines need to perpetuate itself.

I think talking about it in those terms and saying that the capitalism came first is important so that you can see the mechanisms in every moment that need to be pushed. You can see the real pressure points and not get caught in moral questions that aren't meant to be resolved that exist to keep us perpetually batting at yarn in a cage. So the war the the the war between conservatives and liberals that's heating up now. The the the genuine drop in investment in institutions of democracy is a civil war between america's liberals essentially the boomer going to war over woodstock over the cultural revolution of the 60s and 70s one end the urban finance end of capitalism in collision course finally with its with the tail end which was the formation of local extraction economy based capital formations in the slave south and they've been banging and they've been they've been in conflict. Their conflict has driven american politics. For a period. There was a working class element that became a try that became a third poll and you had a sort of tripartite political structure for a minute. There. Then that broke again back to the two back to the dynamic between these two parts of capital petty and small urban and and rural bourgeois basically now international and national bourgeois.

They're having their partisan war that is becoming deeply charged. One part has completely at the grassroots given up on investing in any institutions or norms and that goes through the entire organization meaning yeah. They'll cancel an election if they can of course they would because democrats would let them because democrats are even more comfortable. They believe themselves to be even more comfortable even more snug the reason they're liberals the reason that they're happy to put the rainbow flag of things they believe on their yard and um and endorse theoretical diversity is that they feel more secure in capitalism's bosom than the The national bourgeois do and again we're talking about the people who actually make decisions and who things are generated around not the regular schmucks who are just responding to them. They think they're comfortable national bourgeois.

They're all terrified. They've convinced themselves of the boogeyman because of their racism or but all that even is driven by the fact that they're being crushed. They are being crushed. They will be absorbed into the international finance and they will personally either become cuckified rich people and therefore lose their identity or they're going to keep their keep their identity and become poor that is something they feel and that makes them terrified and all of their fears get manifested in things. Like race. They are afraid of being dominated. They see the way black people are this country that are treated and they imagine that in this new global world where they're on the bottom they will be treated that way too but at the lightly higher levels at the levels of hollywood at the level of the tenured academy. My god where people live in these tastefully segregated integrated neighborhoods or gentrified neighborhoods or in inner ring suburbs where they get their diversity mark largely through the media and therefore they don't have to have fear or their fear can be transmitted into anxiety about the bad white people. They get to sublimate their racial anxiety onto the bad white people which is why they freak out about trump.

They're sublimating their their anxiety to this other group whereas the conservatives know exactly who they're afraid of because they're they haven't inverted it. They haven't sublimated it. They're they're operating out of their wild it. Unlike the the suppression of the superego of fixated. Democrats and both of them are imagining a future that's going to get worse. They don't imagine anything better but what they imagine is their enemy suffering and so we aren't getting to a point of crisis if things get much worse. I mean if supply chain disruption really becomes a thing if the tap of mountain dew runs out if the economy drops again if there's another if they try to do mandatory vaccines if there's another attempt at a lockdown or a first attempt at a national lockdown who knows if there's a close election who knows this is all being generated by one class at war with itself and because we're all experiencing politics as this our categories get confused because most of the people on the left they're on the same cultural side as the liberals. They have overlapping values at a certain level and so they feel the need to address those in their lives and they do.

[53:57](https://youtu.be/1PDZEqc6raY?t=53m57s)

But there's a conflict at the heart of that that can only be pierced by piercing the moral fog around all questions that envelops everything online so I am all about demoralizing our historical analysis demoralizing our opinions about taking away the sense of of self-worth that comes with watching something or listening to something or reading something or telling something or posting something. Now you say that's rich coming from you of course but you know hey. I'm also being compensated for this remember so that's going to make it much easier for me if you're not being compensated for this in anything other than like a psychic wage of moral virtue. If you remove that energy. If you remove that force behind your engagement things become clearer you regain you get something like a post not clarity. Actually you have nutted yourself of your your morals. Backed up anima. Your your your repressed reikian orgone that you have been sublimating into this mind battle. This. You're putting this energy into a mind war blast.

It off see someone says if people logged off no nobody'll listen to you. I've said this before but nobody's logging off. Logging off is not a possibility because our social. I there's no such thing as a person right. We are a cloud of influences. We are so and beyond the fact that we're made up of that. We've encountered. We also cannot define ourselves by anything but comparison so that means we are we we we experience ourselves by experiencing the world and that means experiencing other people. Other other people who can pose a reality that we engage with and fit ourselves with him and that is that used to be inhuman for most of human history that was a direct experience. The entire time of other people over time technology has taken over the media sphere has increased and our degree to which our notion of others comes from this. Diffused technological sphere increases now of course. This is good I mean in a dialectical historical sense. This is necessary you have to create class consciousness across geography and that requires being able to engage with ideas about personhood that extend throughout all of humanity so that's necessary. But as it increases our sense of self becomes mediated.

So if everyone logged off it would leave you in the same life you lived. I mean presuming you live the same life with essentially a limb removed. You will you would find yourself unable to navigate the world because of how much of your understanding of what the world is comes. From this. This zone this abstract zone so we're all we all have to do it to some extent now. I think some people could cut it off if they were going to change their life in a significant way. Like if you join a commune you probably can log completely off if you re if you are able to create a situation where you are able to replace have that cut off limb regrow in the form of a newest new relationship to others. If you start organizing you can probably cut off completely but you know well. But if you still are where you are and most of us are because we don't get to choose that you know we can try to direct the ship but we can't just redirect we cannot dictate terms.

Immediately. We cannot take a moment of clarity and try to re reshuffle the deck completely. We're still constrained which is why you can never talk about someone being in you know about you know you cannot talk about there being some like mute moment of immune illumination where we all come together and we all have an understanding because every moment we're being jostled away from that and directing things differently takes time so shrinking you know reducing the size of it. Reducing the vitalness of it as an organ of self-conception is is laudable but I stopped telling people to log off a while ago.

It's more about reorienting your emotional relationship to it because then that will dictate how much time you spend there because if you do not invest these questions with more moral energy they become a lot less interesting you know what if somebody's just literally pitch crypto that's very funny. You know what blockchain the beauty of this thing is is that if this is true if the resistance to capitalism is within our like technological infrastructure is finally coming into fruition through the blockchain and crypto. If that's true it's going to happen when no matter what I think about it. I will not be contributing in any way because I don't know technology. I understand the arguments for blockchain the way that it could keep money from being. It would be able to prevent capital flight and mutt and tax evasion and stuff okay you know. I read that in ministry for the future but you know all the crypto currencies seem like speculative assets of an economy that's run out of profitable investment opportunities.

I mean that definitely seems to have been the motive forget anything oh we're gonna be stable whatever libertarian crackpot notions undergirded it's building and I bet that was the motivation because those people were motivated. They really believe that because they have aligned their politics with their sense of self-interest they think libertarianism will get them rich so they'll work for free because they've convinced themselves that they're gonna. This thing's gonna work for them even though for most of them it absolutely will not. They will be destroyed spiritually and financially. But they really believe that shits and they have the technological those guys have. Technological respects man that that's one place that the right has the left feet 12 ways to sunday is that those humanities graduates self included so whatever those guys were thinking very quickly.

It became first a money laundering device for avoiding taxes and buying things illegally which is a tax issue at the end of the day and a currency issue. Like they're basically. The government basically says you can't that money is no good for that thing You can't buy that with this and over time as a speculative asset. I mean honestly. I'm wondering to what degree is bitcoin still used to buy stuff considering how volatile it is value is and how much interest people have in it as a long-term investment opportunity and as a short-term like shake. The money tree type thing it just seems like the profit motive has dominated it completely and that you would need that counterweight of people within it all pushing in the same direction out of not self-interest not financial interest. I should say and I don't see the structures within it to to encourage that so once again that's about as much thought as I have to put into it because it would be dumb of me to have a strong opinion on bitcoin or cryptocurrency or to spend much time talking about it because I'm I know with the time I have on this earth. I'm not going to be learning about it that's for sure.

I do think that the amount of energy it uses is monstrous and I do think that the basic the the phenomenon of of cryptocurrency and nfts is the market looking for speculative assets where they cannot be found because even speculative profits are now largely being worked out of the system. Like long-term profits which of course are always are been trending down since the 70s are now such that you can't even get into a volatile market now and so there so the thing I can't get over with this is that they literally take economic growth which is supposed to be what investment creates like you invest money so that work is done right and that work then creates more value. That is then profit that you get to take right that's the capitalist cycle now that work is involves human labor. It involves technology. It involves natural resources of some kind some sort of input and it involves externalities in the form of pollution and energy used for the transaction at the end of which you have a thing in some way. In some respect you have a thing that is then that then contributes to like the built economy and can then serve as the purpose for more growth. Bitcoin removes the productive part of the investment. Cycle leaves the creation of energy the weight the use of energy and the ex the exhaust of externalities in the form of of these goddamn bitcoin mining rigs using electricity and and pumping carbon into the atmosphere without actually producing anything. That is just that is the death. That's the death spiral man that is capitalism at the terminal point where the profit motive has outstripped all signals from the profit and at the end of that you have a situation where there's no more this thing cannot innovate anymore.

This thing cannot be a progressive force. It is it outlasted its historic purpose like. I said marx didn't think capitalism was evil. He thought it was and it and this is one of the another place where moralism gets confused is that at the time right marx was writing. Capitalism was serving historical purpose. He thought that that purpose was coming to an end and that's when he was that why he predicted imminent revolution but colonialism and the united states basically saved it colonial domination and super exploitation of resources in the periphery saved capitalism in a way that marx could not have predicted. We're now at the point where capitalism has fully exhausted its historic role. Its progressive role of creating innovation of concentrating capital of creating cultural superstructures nostalgias of no ideas and and institutional knowledge that could be used to direct a technological society towards social ends to to take the machine and reprogram it to turn the terminator into the child protector and that was the historic role of the working. Class was to was to do that was to change the programming and they failed and we live in the aftermath of that failure and so now capitalism is deeply immoral in everything you can't even say it's it's progressive anymore. It does not even serve a historic purpose. It is ju because obviously it was also immoral and marx used very scornful language to condemn the immorality of the ruling class. But they were also fulfilling a historic role. Now they are just evil just pure. Evil consumption is evil if it has replaced morality which is which it has and by morality. I mean a fully in consumption is a part of life but it is like anything supposed to be fixed in a matrix with other parts of life meaning other things other stores of value. Let's put it that way the value form in capitalism overwhelms.

Eventually all values and and exchange value is the only value but those are of course the difference between those two things which is an illusory fantasy and if we've and we live in a culture and a society we live in a society that has reified that into a principle that dominates all others to a way that is not sustainable. I mean it's going to destroy the world not end life on earth probably but destroy what it thinks it's creating destroy the thing that it's supposed to serve which is human civilization. I mean my god you have this. Going to space you have this goblin saying thank you to the amazon workers and customers for paying for this. As if there's any deal we could make with him that would make that that would mean we won like you can talk all day about oh. I got 500 socks and I clicked a button. I got 500 socks to my house in two hours okay congratulations you got that convenience you got that consumption but what did you give up for it and what you gave up for is every other part of humanity and your own ability to determine your life like at a basic level. You've given yourself over to a machine. We all have and we get to watch this guy go hey. I'm going to pretend to go to space. I'm going to pretend to go to space. I'm going to do something that isn't even. 50s with two tin cans tied together. Nope sorry. Someone on twitter pointed this out and I think it's it's true. It said he clearly sat down with his his space dudes and said okay. I want to go to space how can I do that in a way that doesn't require me to train and isn't going to kill me. And I said we'll just take you up and like show you the curvature of the earth. It's just. It's just a big boy goes on a plane ride and then he comes down and says we're gonna take all the factories and put him in outer space which is such a should be an in such an insult to the mind of anyone.

How anyone can hear them say someone say that and not instantly be disenchanted from capitalism astounds me. This man has more money than anybody. In the on earth. He directly benefits from the exploitation of people and their labor at every point in a global supply chain of misery by any any system of value that is wrong unless he deserves it and that is capitalist morality. He is there because he deserves it how could he deserve it. Now the old days hierarchy was upheld by saying he deserves it because god put him there shut up liberalism came along rationalism came along the enlightenment science. It became harder to convince people of that and so that became they're there because of a meritocratic process that put them there as they should and that was the liberal revolution to take the industrial revolution and replace orders of superstition with rational orders of merit that was the french revolution that was napoleon marching across europe that was the 19th century was the imposition of those ideas that by the 20th century were hegemonic and then eventually overwhelmed the world hegemonic in the west.

So now you have a situation where we have this so-called meritocracy. That of course a lot of people don't believe. In some people say leftists say it's not a meritocracy because meritocracy is fake but liberals would say no meritocracy is just not perfectly implemented. The multicultural liberal project is the attempt to impose a perfect meritocracy through affirmative action through redistribution necessary to get to that point so according to liberals we are going. We are more meritocratic than they used to be but we're not meritocratic enough. The important thing is that we're meritocratic enough so that every individual liberal deserves to be where they are in the system if they're benefiting from it if they feel like they're benefiting from it. That is that's the neat coincidence said yes. There's a lot of white people who succeed but shouldn't a lot of white men am I right ladies who shouldn't but not me. Now. There are a lot of liberals though who say you know it's not that racist calm down. But there are also conservatives who say who aren't full race warriors who do think that you know what even though there's affirmative action and and the media and stuff we still basically have a fair system of capitalism so like. I would say the center the center. The vital center of capitalist belief in this country says we have a system that is meritocratic enough that the richest man on earth should deserve that through some sort of genius some sort of ability equal to that amount of money and that and he does not deserve to be up there or he's lying to you which means that he is not a meritocrat but a fraud either way he should not be there and certainly the fact that he believe he thinks you're going to believe him is the should be the ultimate insult more than anything the fact that he thinks that some portion of you are going to believe him either agree with him or even think. He thinks that he does not have any respect that's for sure but yeah no nobody who says something like that after blowing all that money and then telling people yeah. This is your money. I'm blowing goes up does that comes back has that result can possibly say that capitalism has not failed. It has failed in that it has fulfilled its historical destiny and is still hanging around. We have to rebuild some sort of workers resistance to it that can contest for power as it declines which it is.

I was supposed to talk about black jack wins today but I ended up going off on a bit of a tangent. You know what next week. I'll do I might just do the whole rest of the book next week because the thing is it's much more. It's it's much less detail-oriented than um than the other books. We've done the historical ones anyway like reconstruction. It's it's much more like sweeping narratives so how about for next week. I'll just read the rest of it all right. I hope some of that made sense bye.
