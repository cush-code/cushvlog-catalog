How's everybody doing today. I hope everyone is relaxing and chillaxing man. It's been a hell of a week for old perverts huh some good stuff good stuff. First you got jeffrey tube out slapping his hog around while zooming um proving that he just couldn't he couldn't continue to simulate the 2020 election from the point of view of the legal system and not satisfy. His uh unleashed hog because of how erotic that is and I understand election simulation is intensely erotic but I think the beauty giuliani thing is of course hilarious and I think people are kind of missing the force for the trees. I feel like when they're talking about it because a lot of people are hitting on the fact that oh according to this story uh borat claimed that this girl was 15 and that she took rudy into another room and laid him on the bed and like he was gonna.

A 15 year old and then other people are saying uh actually and apparently they're being paid to say this in swarms on the internet actually. Uh that's the 15 claim uh was never made to rudy giuliani that she looked like a young woman and that he had no reason to believe she was underage and people are arguing that point and to me that is a pointless point who cares the reality take think about this situation think about the reality of what happened rudy. Giuliani thinks that he's going to have an interview with what some russian journalists or something they take him to a hotel room. They talk to him for a while. It's wacky but whatever and at the end of it this young woman just leads him into another room and what does he do. He immediately just lies on the bed that's what rudy giuliani expects to happen when he has any kind of public interaction. That's what these people do this 75 year old gargoyle.

He goes into these nice air-conditioned rooms to talk to a bunch of guys named like ivan stroganoff about like some sort of uh money laundering operation or data swap or whatever the  he's been doing in ukraine and russia. Whatever like just money on his grind and at the end of those meetings like instead of a cheese course they just lead them into a room and a woman who he has no idea who they are where they came from if they've been  trafficked or what age they are just lays him in a bed and just sucks him off that's his expected encounter in the day think about that think about how socially conditioned he is to expect that what the  are doing this is the proof you need that the only thing that's crazy about q anon is thinking that donald trump or anybody else in a position of power wants to stop this. It's just a giant disgusting power orgy. These guys are doing rich.

I mean as they literally suck the vital vital fluids out of every human being on this planet and turn us into just hollowed out uh. Capri suns they enact ritualized conquest. A despoilation of humanity through just this wretched disgusting sexual depravity and they don't even have to be thinking in these kind of epic ritualistic terms. All they could just be feeling is how do. I fill the hole within me that is made by being a soulless uh uh a capitalist husk like I am nothing I am empty of any goodness any virtue. What can I pursue and the only answer is selfish pleasures and what does that mean it means even when you're 75 you've still got to have some disinterested maybe sex slave tug you off in a radisson. That's how  empty you are and that means that your life is just.

It is public and private uh obscenity and uh despoilation of humanity solo really got to the heart of all of this and that means all these guys do this trump bill clinton uh bezos. Allegedly. All of them are just have turned sexual debasement of people that they have power over into a component of high stakes. Public and private negotiations of power folks. They're gross. They're sickos. Q is correct about that they are genuine sickos. The problem is that there are no white hats if there are white hats. It's us. We have to be the white hats no one in anywhere anywhere close to a position of power. They are either blissfully unaware of all the ritualized sexual. Uh uh degradation or or they enthusiastically participate in it maybe at best. They've reluctantly participated it because it's necessary to maintain trust at those high levels of power and intimacy any way you slice it.

No one in power is going to do anything about this and and the belief that anything otherwise is. True is the real fantasia at the heart of q all the craziest. In the universe comes not from that essential insight about power and about the people who wield it but from trying to make sense of trump somehow being opposed to it. That's where the crazy stuff comes in. That's where the the clones and the lizard people and the  uh holograms the secret guantanamo uh uh executions. All of that is generated by the need to make sense of the basic fantasy. That trump is in any way really opposed to power and the monsters who wield it rather than being a perfect exemplar of their class. So it's really is important to say like what is the cue delusion. It really isn't anything to do with their analysis of like who who rules power who rules broadly speaking and what they do with their rule what they pursue with the power. They have the personal indulgence that they seek as their sole means of soul distraction and and uh pleasure that's all just real good solid materialist analysis of power. It's thinking that anyone in power will stop it that is madness and that could only create more madness and that delusion is powered by the fact that they're americans god bless them and they are ensorced to the fantasy of the two-party system to politics as a meaningful endeavor and that means that they have to map their deeper understanding of the horrors of power onto this shallow fantasy of genuine uh partisan conflict where in reality you just have a organic uh osmotic relationship of power within this one organism of the democratic republican political party machinery and uh and uh cultural attachments. I'm auto-tuned what's going on. I'm sorry. I was  with the mixer oh that's funny I am a robot hello. I am a robot programmed to party I am a party bot and I love to party but sadly that's going to be. One of the last illusions to die is the idea that there's genuine uh genuine conflict real high-stakes conflict at the high between the democratic and republican parties and we're gonna have to enact more and more symbolic uh and then not symbolic acts uh to consecrate those realities in the face of what's really going on which is bipartisan rule by the dracula sex criminal elite.


There's someone's asking for good uh books on gladio. There's not a lot of great books about gladio honestly. All the good stuff is italian and untranslated. There's two ways to go though broadly there's two books that you can go to if you want to go dry and academic and more grounded and also uh a broader than simply italy like more into like. It has a nato network a a nato program of a network of cells within places like belgium and uh france and spain and uh even sweden even switzerland. Even though it was technically part of nato. They had a they had a uh a gladio program there uh it's called nato's secret armies. I believe it's pdf available on the internet uh and then it'll give you that and it's a little dry but it'll give you the overview if you want to get pulpy. Though you got to go with arch cast catholic lunatic paul williams book operation gladio which uh it reads like sort of the skeleton of a james elroy novel just the plot stuff without any of the charac. The characters of you know repressed cops uh uh beating up uh nightclub singers and there's not and there's stuff in there. That is it is much more speculative uh including his uh tale of the possible. Uh murder of john paul the first at the hands of uh gladio figures uh and also the likely gladio involved involvement in the assassination of attempt against john paul ii. It's an undisputed fact of history that the assassin the attempted assassin of john paul ii was a turkish ultra-nationalist gray wolf. Uh and the gray wolves were one of those gladio created uh paramilitary organizations that sprouted up after world war ii. It was directly created by the the generals uh who were the implementers of gladio in turkey and he also was only able to go to saint peter's square and shoot uh. John paul ii because he had been uh arrested in turkey and imprisoned for the murder of a left-wing journalist and then had just escaped prison and by according to all a testimony he's just walking out of it and then he showed up uh in saint. Peter's square shot john paul ii uh and like. I said not a lot of sources but it's all very interesting.

It's. It's the it's the indulgent one and it's also a little. The the pros is a little more uh punchy but you know. I don't. I don't say everything in that book is true you have to look at everything with a critical eye and but a lot of the wildest. In that book you look it up and it's oh yeah the part of the problem is he doesn't have a lot of good sourcing in it uh. But if you take the time to like follow down specific leads named around people and names it's very interesting. It's like they're like uh a nato general in italy was arrested uh for uh involvement in like the drug trade and did indeed uh epstein himself in prison like that happened. Like the one big the one main uh witness in the credit on braziano scandal that brought down the vatican bank and exposed the gladio network and p2 uh was just poisoned in prison. Like there wasn't even an attempt to make it look like a suicide. He just drank some coffee that yes had a  figured out who did it and they just said yep poison wild. So if you want to go down the rabbit hole. Those are good ways to start those are different entry points but either way you're not going to know and I like to like anytime. I get into the nitty-gritty. Like gladio or any of the assassinations or even kennedy or whatever I always try to remind myself that at the end of the day this is mostly recreational because your ability to get to anything like a comprehensive overview of the  evidence of of that can fill in the gaps. It's not going to happen and seeking it can kind of drive. You crazy but it is fun and you have to experience it. I think the best way to do. It is fun and the thing is. It's also constructive because while you're sifting through the conspiracy uh silt you could get a ton of gold that you can hang on to like what you mainly have to do is. Just stop is not have to feel like you have to carry around in your head.

A resolved answer to a lot of the questions surrounding stuff. Like this then it really doesn't matter if you know in your heart whether one it's one way or the other because when you get to that point that belief is going to end up being brittle because you're always speculating and then because it's a brittle belief. You end up having to defend it in public compulsively because you're just anxious about it all the time because you haven't convinced yourself and that leads you further away from the truth and further towards pointless confrontation to reinforce your ideas instead of just allowing yourself to glide between and just remember. What you what the bedrock is you know between what you think you know about the world and what you know is speculative and uh and anytime we find ourselves getting really wound up around questions specifically of like more moral questions and questions of like historical uh veracity. You have to be able to recognize when you're sort of floating when you've lost uh connection to bedrock and and and that'll keep you from just keeping yourself on the wrong course you and you can stop swimming and just kind of float back towards the shore. I just used like 17 metaphors there and they were all absolute gibberish. I'm such a dumbass. How's it going in the chat guys. I'm taking a look here seeing what we have oh man. Someone says just jesse ventura and I'm just reminded again of what we lost by him not running as the green party candidate a synthesis of trump and bernie the one we need too bad.

Uh people say like why would why would gladio guys want to kill john paul ii. It's not like he was a liberation theologist. He was a good cold warrior yes. But according to williams he refused to bail out the vatican bank with money that they could have done it with. They're basically saying that he was uh too because he was not really aware of the whole program. He had sort of come in from the outside you know he was a pull lock. He wasn't part of the inner circle of uh uh american and italian uh prelates who were like in p2 even though uh catholics are not supposed to join the freemasons. All these guys all these italian guys were on p2 but he was sort of outside of it so he didn't really know what the vatican bank was in terms of this crucial element of the global uh like arms and drug trade that was financing the uh the the right the paramilitary right in italy and maintaining this the balance of powers that prevented the communists from coming to power. He wasn't aware of that. He was just like no no he shouldn't do that that's corrupt and then that helped lead to an a lot of spillage and a big scandal that led to the collapse of a number of the banks a big a short-term economic crisis in in italy and then eventually the revealing of the entire uh p2 net organization and gladio itself. So you could see why there might have been a motive to perforate that  and get somebody who in there who would spread the money around and keep things on the qt but as I said. I don't know it's fun to talk about. It's fun to speculate about. But I don't know yeah godfather. Three actually talks about all this. Uh john paul the first getting poisoned and I honestly feel like that one's almost an open and shut case. I feel like he was probably as close as I'm gonna get to confident. I'm gonna say that john paul the first was  gacked that this dude coming in here and taking he wanted to look at the books is the thing and that was not going to happen 33 days in the pontificate but yeah not over any uh. Any doctrinal issues just purely covering their asses related to the giant drug money laundering inauguration that they had going. That's the thing that I don't think is a question. Whether or not the assassinations happened is up in the air but whether or not the vatican was laundering drug money for the mafia and the cia.

I don't think there's a question about that one which is kind of nuts when you think about it because that does sound like crazy conspiracy gibberish and it often gets put in with other stuff that is more outlandish. But it's basically established fact and it doesn't change anything and that's my real problem with conspiracy theory as a heuristic is that it presupposes that revelation of the secret will somehow change the reality. The end result of every security of every conspiracy narrative is a generalized awareness. It's supposed to end in a congressional hearing or opening of files or testimony that brings to light a secret reality that people aren't aware of and that's why q is. The perfect accelerated version of this because it imagines an apocalyptic revelation. All that you knew all the people you thought were uh were trusted. Custodians of power or or celebrities are actually demonic. Creatures bent on your destruction and we are saving you from them and that's not how it's going to work if we're going to beat any of this. Leonard cohen would say everybody knows every other worst thing you could imagine everybody at a base level knows. If we found out tomorrow that bush did 9 11. It wouldn't change anything it would have go from a thing that people kind of thought was true to like ah yeah. There you go. I have figures we have normalized everything because at a bone deep level we know and we just distract ourselves from that reality by carrying out these ritualized political performances that imbue our life with meaning and drama and distract us from that fundamental truth and so no nothing based on like educating people about like what the bad guys did and and who they are is gonna do anything knowledge alone will do nothing. Only knowledge that is generated from action is anything that can be built upon and that's what comes from people doing things together and finding in the doing of things.

Together purpose is the bird drinking the birds drinking chris. We were worried. The bird wasn't gonna drink that  is guzlin very happy to see it. I love a good drinking bird. Don't we all love folks. We love it the bird. He drinks. He's the best he's the best at drinking. They say they say he's the best. There is. I don't know. I honestly think it might be me folks. I think I drink better. I drink really good I use both hands never spill a drop. Never get a job spilled ever never spill a drop by my tie.


The silk. The silk ties trump seems like he's uh. He's not happy right. Now. I think maybe uh. The the steroids are wearing off a little bit storming away from the uh. The 60 minutes interview not a good sign. I think he's gonna be tonight tomorrow night. I'm very much looking forward to. I think it'll be fun so here's the thing we were thinking about. I'm gonna put this to you guys. I kind of don't want to stream the debate itself just because watching the first one it really felt like having a hat on a hat to have anyone even commenting because it. Was like the shape of the thing was what was funny and it was kind of felt wrong to interrupt it and yet we couldn't stop uh.

I was thinking maybe since this is going to be the last one where they're like together in the same room uh and that means trump's going to be rip snorting and hooton and torton because I really don't think that there's any way that they can uh pacify him. At this point uh short of rhino tracks. I think it's going to be a absolute cacophony and as such I think it might be better experience just as something you allow to uh wash over you. But maybe we could do a post debate react where we just kind of go. Over. Some of the highlights does anyone sound does that sound fun to anybody does that sound like a good idea getting getting some agreement. It looks like we're getting good approval on that all right.

Let's do that then all right it'll be at least me and chris we'll see if we can get any other buddy anybody else to go on. I think everyone else was so destroyed by that last debate and so traumatized that they haven't been able to even think about doing another talk about one and I can pull up clips and stuff afterwards and we can watch the highlights and I had a great time. I had such a good time watching that debate eventually after I pushed through. But then I had a great time watching the dueling town halls. Uh honestly that's I hope. I wish. They did that more it was a vibe as they say it was a vibe all right. So we're going to do. We're going to do a react that sounds good all right perfect. We'll see who else wants to do it remember when matt did joker make up for the bernie debate. I remember. I remember that that was back during joker vacation which was the last stage before grill vilification kicked in oh god remember when I got super drunk oh. I really don't others do poor chris oh man.

I feel so bad about that that was a real bungle. Uh can. I make a um embarrassing mia culpa for that uh. I feel terrible about that whole incident mostly because I was the one who brought the rum. I was the one who said you know what let's get. Let's get real real wild for this and then. I was so consumed with running my first ever elaborate stream that uh uh you know. I feel like that was a producerial lapse um yeah but I'm still the  disgusting glutton who drank an entire bottle of rum without realizing. I was the producer saying that it would be good. It would make for good tape so. I think we can. I want to take like 50 of the the uh well. I'll take a little load off because it does still bash me a little bit. I just assumed others would be drinking from it and I didn't notice that. I was the only one pouring from it until I was like halfway done and then it's like the momentum had taken over well. I drank the entire thing and that was overproofed yes. It was overproof that was over. Proof took the entire thing to the dome god yeah that was uh. I think that was the I'd have not gotten anywhere near that drunk since then. I think that was like the low point for me alcohol wise in a while uh yeah. So.

I think. I'm doing much better now. I'll take this moment in that recollection to say that we are planning on doing some kind of elaborate election night broadcast absolutely and I will not be hammered off of rum we will keep it keep it under uh control and try to put it I might. I'm not no promises. I might be rolling hell yeah. I might be uh. I might have some acid in me uh or I might have chinese research chemicals. But there will be no uh  handle of uh rum to the face. I'll just take this moment to try to promise to put on the in because I've been feeling very depressed over the last few days that one of the things covett has taken from us is getting to do a big election night show yeah that would have been so fun  coveted the china virus but I will try to put on as big of a best of show as I can from this gonna be here.

In the office. We're gonna finally get to use this whole set which uh chris had made and which is fantastic. It's going to be like the dick cavett show when peter falk and john cassavetes and ben gazzaro are there just a rollicking good time as we watch the election not get called. That's the funniest part because there will be no call that night um unless biden wins at a huge landslide. Uh there will likely not be a call on election night which is uh. This is the first time I think in a long time that that has happened with anyone expecting it to be the case. I think we all just assume that you'll get a call before uh midnight but I don't think we're getting that this year although you know there's that whole thing about we're at a position now where a biden landslide is more likely than trump winning in any way. You know so those polls could be you know because polls can be wrong two ways and if they're under counting biden in some way and I understand not saying that's likely. It's like it's possible. If you could see a huge landslide and even with the  right and ballots you might have the thing you might have enough electoral votes decided to uh end it then and honestly that would be one of the funniest things in the world. If we had a goddamn uh after this like hugely uh dramatic build up about how we're getting ready to reach some sort of civil war type situation. Like it's  republican spain all over again and then whoop uh. It's over go back to the brunch everybody.


The uh uh we've switched to a kindly old grandpa instead of a crazy old grandpa. Uh the chicago seven episode will be tomorrow. I've watched it. It was I gotta say it was entertaining. It's his movies. I think are better than his tv shows just in terms of uh being entertaining because I mean the shows are what they are you know brutal sklogs his movies. Molly's game is fun. A few good men is a solid 90s. Uh programmer. Uh american president's pretty good and zippy and has some good stuff in it. Uh um social network is a great movie. He's uh charlie's wilson. Wilson's wore his absolute dog. But there are good movies among those movies. I just listed there are no good shows among his shows. I think it's because he can't allow he can't like he every time he starts making a project. He's locking himself in his garage and just farting essentially and it's like the shorter the project. The less time he has to just die of fart inhalation which is what happens on his tv shows. He just starts huffing nothing but pure methane and I think with a shorter run time and a shorter character arcs. He's able to sort of trim the fat and and keep it entertaining instead of uh sucking on his own donk.

But I think it's a fun movie. It's fine but the lib delib the lib the lib. In that movie it is pure uncut liberalism and uh it is yes. It is the purest form of the liberalism. It is quite liberal of course. The real hero of the movie is the prosecutor as uh that's of course perfect for uh for him. It's just so perfect. So we'll talk about that if I can get a hold of an hbo max login. I want to watch that  uh west wing hamilton election special that they did that is available now. I don't know why they would leave that on hbo max. If they really wanted to affect the election isn't that just proof that this is all stroke off  streaming service for a streaming service. It's not even hbo which means the people who are going to watch. It are people who already vote are you  lemon party of liberal piety. Everybody eating each other's spray wouldn't you make that  free wouldn't you put it on youtube nope 30 a month pros. If you want to learn how important it is to vote and participate in our electoral system but I would like to watch it.

I would like to see what it is. I thought see. I wasn't too excited when it was. It debuted because I thought it was just a table read but apparently it's a whole production and the lin manuel miranda is in there lin-manuel miranda as we call him in the midwest. Lin-manuel miranda god get that nasal what's going on what's going on what is the body without organs uh my butt. We should do a chapel election simulation like the one that was stimulating the erection of jeffrey tube out. Everybody plays a different element somebody's the deep state somebody's a deep state.

Somebody's q somebody is uh uh nancy pelosi's blood bag that'd be funny. I am not q let me just say that oh god mitch mcconnell's hands hands are only supposed to get that red if blood is pooling in them which is what happens after the heart cease is pumping if once you die like if you lie in bed and your heart stops beating your blood stops circulating in your body and it settles so if you're lying down it settles in your like butt and in your back. If you were to like be hung up. It would settle in your hands. He looks like a corpse on a  fistful of like uh of beetroot. He's got these big yam fingers that are bright red. He's got a he's got like the pedophile association signet ring on and you can't even see it around the  alive.

They are being kept alive by eldritch rituals. It's either eve literal. I'm either talking because like there's two ways. This could be true right and this is true of all good conspiracy stuff. The stuff that tracks there's a shadow like narrative reality and then there is the bear you know uh uh material base that it comes from and in the case of uh of like the unnatural long life of these freakish old. It's they are using sorcery right. They're doing ritualistic sacrifice of the innocent to power like a satanic machinery of life that fills them unnaturally but the bare material reflection uh reality that that gets turned into by the mind is because these guys just get to swim in an ocean of abstracted surplus value that is torn out of everybody else in the world at the expense of their own health and happiness and ability to thrive and have access to material uh restoration. They're able to have access to the the most developed forms of capital uh in every air aspect of technology that includes medicine so look at that fat piece of  for four years who got owned by him in the primary and then simperingly kissed his ass and got his.


Mcdonald's in the hope that he'd get in. The cabinet got turfed out of the white house by jared kushner because he put his daddy in jail and how dare he put his wonderful dad who was an absolute scumbag and huge criminal and 100 guilty in jail. It's not like his dad was one of the central park five and then he goes off into the wilderness grubs around on  sports d sports radio guy and he can't even hack that and then he comes back crawling to trump gets coveted because he has to be a alpha like trump and not wear a mask and now and then that guy who is just a giant bundle of comorbidities. A  uh of new jersey. He has no executive power. He has no need for what does he do what's the point of chris christie. What is he doing he is unnecessary. He's going to call into mike and the mad dog and complain about the cowboys. He's a  waste of space. He's lost. His political career is over his usefulness to the cabal is finished.

It's not anything other than an errand boy and he still gets the experimental super serum that allows him to survive a  uh steroids that would make sea biscuit's heart explode. He gets to survive maybe who knows how long he seems like he's running at a high temperature he could just pop at any minute but he's still going and that is the aldrich ritual that is their access to the the this stuff that we don't get none of us get that why why are we less worthy of the beneficence of our social product of our of our scientific advances that the fat puck piece of  new jersey and I know people might say that I'm being ableist or or lucas about fat people first of all. I am not a thin man myself secondly. I use that just to say that christy as a man who has no socioeconomic uh uh determiners that might make him a larger a man who has access to all of the benef. The the highest beneficence of being in a high earner in america meaning access to good food exercise regimes the ability to stay uh healthy and and given and the fact that he has driven enough to acquire uh material uh power and wealth and influence and position to this and be focused enough to be a. It's just. It's proof that he is like many of our ruling class just a disgusting uh a selfish scumbag and that none of them have any virtues to speak of and that their lack of virtue manifests itself in different ways and in this specific form of chris christie. It's in his the fact that he's a  crack out like the case of uh.

You know the the eight the 1796 uh rothschild. You know like the 200 000 bottle of wine for chris christie. He has nothing to give anyone and yet he still gets it because he's in the  club. He gets the miracle cure because he's been initiated into the cult of malik and so he gets access to it. So yeah. They are ritually sucking the life of the rest of us and using it to unnaturally extend their own lives. Mitch. Mcconnell would be dead if he was a pharmacist donald trump would be dead if he was a guy who worked at a grocery store. Instead they all lived forever yes chris christie was too big to fail indeed what's going on what's going on what's going on hey what's going on. What's going on hey.

What happened with the moon has the announcement happening yet. I believe the announcement is coming monday oh how are you going to tease me that long well that's how they get that's how they get you to tune into nasa. These days you have to that's great that's true they've really learned they're leaning into the game show host model and hey it worked for the president at least for so for so long. It has we'll see yeah but the moo they're gonna drop moon too. It would be so funny if they're like uh. We're blowing up the moon remember that mr show sketch. We're just gonna do that america can and must and will blow up the moon and we're gonna do it during a full moon to make sure we get it. All. Hey mr monkey don't be asking why cause you don't mess around with american pride. C.s. Lewis jr. Man. That's a good show. Mr show mr show yes formative program for me. Really. Uh yeah help create my uh my outlook in many ways but yeah.

What else could it be. They're gonna put a base on it that would be cool. They found life. There can't be life on the moon. I I've said this before but my most nationalist take is that it uh. It sucks that we can't put that we have lost the ability the domestic ability to put americans into space yeah. If we're gonna count out. There we should invest we should like take it seriously don't don't  because there's a lot to learn there and there's a lot of stuff that could help us domestically and it does. But it should be part of a broader you know effort that is not. This bare bones monstrosity that we see before us yeah and also I think it works on the um symbolic level to like show people that the state is still capable of doing things.

Someone wants to grill a thanksgiving turkey good lord how could you possibly do that very carefully very good grill on the moon yes before the end of the decade. American who's the grill on the moon not because it is easy but because I am hard I am very hard. I am the president. I am the horny president. My name is john f kennedy and I am the haunting president. You know what he actually wasn't that much hornier than a lot of those guys though. Although he was in the top quartile. I will say that but lbj also wildly horny big time horny. He once said about jfk quote. I've had more women on accident that that boy has on purpose uh warren g harding uh impregnated a woman in the senate cloak room that happened oh.


I've been seeing earlier in the stream. There were a lot of calls that uh you should put an offer on quibby matt. Uh yes. Let's no apparently they're not no one's yeah no one's buying it. So. I think we might be able to get it for pennies on the dollar. I think that all six of us should forego one month's uh. Uh salary yeah put an offer in. I wonder what would we do with it will we keep the idea of it being quick bits. Uh just slowly increase the number of bits and decrease the number of shows until you're just putting out one really good show on quivi oh okay. I get what you're saying oh okay like all the different shows start off as separate shows but then you slowly realize that they're all part of one big show and eventually all the dividing lines between the shows go away and then it's just one long program and then it never ends yes and it becomes a show that like keeps it's oh. People love tracking out extended universes realizing that one character in one show is like the audit of another character in another show yeah. No that's it so that shows that's charlie kaufman presents. Quibby yeah we got to get him his creative director charlie quaffman with a q. That's what we'll call it charlie quaffman looking at my cards here uh folks. I was talking before the stream that the um the the desert storm trading cards have been a great source of uh fun and riffing on the stream but you know there's only so much juice that desert storm has. If you can anybody suggest another thing that would be just you know something we could pull randomly of that would like a desert storm trading card to uh to know uh uh inspire tangents garbage pail kids.

I'm sure you would be uh disgusted by the horrible garbage pill kids matt pathetic. No I actually had a big old. I had a large garbage pail kid collection in my home when I was a child and then one day my sister. My skunk of his younger sister went in and took them all off took all the stickers off the backing oh. I was furious but I really enjoyed them. I enjoyed the the garbage pail children. They were disgusting and hideous but I i thought they were cute. I liked them a lot uh they were awesome and and epic. I think uh you know and a lot of them were very gross like they want. They got really serious.

Like. Some of those are some of the art in those things. You've got real like grotesque  and viscera and blood and guts. But I remember they did a reissue of them a few years ago and I bought a pack out of nostalgia and they were like updated and there were references to like gangnam style and  this get out of here terrible so somebody suggested um q anon trading cards which I didn't know if it was real or not and I had to look up and uh there are apparently q and on trading cards in the style of something else. We've talked about this uh magic the gathering and I think if I could get my hands on one of these. I would love to bring them in that sounds awesome. The ones they have displayed is uh flynn uh who is a creature type former us army general dash patriot. They also have a um hogwash former parkland student dash traitor david hogg.

He's of course in the swamp  hog. I think we should get our hands. On some of this. We need those. I need to must cop as the kids say I'll see if. I can I'll try. I can track some down uh. There's one here that I enjoyed out of this pack. It's uh personnel navy u.s navy seals having their roots in world war. Ii sea air land seal teams are trained in unconventional warfare. They perform reconnaissance underwater demolition and special operations in coastal areas yeah like afghanistan. Highly mobile and lightly armed they rely on stealth concealment and surprise to accomplish most operations. This elite forces members are highly educated and physically fit. I just wanted to show this because the actual picture is a couple of beefcakes with no shirts on on the beach.

It's like it's not a dude in an outfit with his you know his scuba suit and a mp5 or something. It's just some hunks playing doing the volleyball scene from top gun. They do. I gotta say they look pretty hunky but none of them are looking at the camera because you have to maintain opsec which I respect. Matt did you see the uh that video from the egyptian army that was going around the other oh hell yeah. The parade of beefcakes oh man I'm trying to find that real quick cece's egypt is on on one man they're really having a good time over there god. There's got to be something freeing about just having naked military rule like not even pretending to put a patina of politics on it. Like oh yeah. The army just runs everything that just feels like kind of soothing and then what do you get out of it. You get parades of beefcake you get sweet beefcake parades and we love to see it okay. Let's see if I can bring this up hunks. Let's look at some of that beefcakes. It's raining man hallelujah is raided men yeah yeah. It's raining man. Hallelujah is raining man yeah yeah. Look at those boys look at those beefy boys. Does it have a soundtrack. Uh let's see absolutely so get wet. They are ripped. These guys are ripped I i gotta say if I was if.

I was the uh the false government of libya uh standing in the way of the glorious general haftar. I would be waking in my boots all right folks any questions in the chat so thoughts on bolivia. I thought we covered bolivia twice. This week yeah bolivia. I think we got our words out there oblivion. Uh we it's all as usual. It's we'll see that's how it all boils down.


But it's certainly a better. It's I think better than the alternative in every respect for now so that's good uh. I want a shout out this was way back when matt was talking about the uh. The pope about how the assassination of the pope was obliquely referenced in the new pope uh new pope young pope great series highly recommend both of those. I got matt to watch the young pope which he didn't really care for but new pope you were pretty into yeah. I couldn't really vibe with the austere hair shirt uh jude law pope. I was on much more on the same wavelength with the uh erotic sensuous indulgence pope uh john paul iii played by john malkovich. I was like okay. This guy wants to seduce people into catholicism. I'm vibing on that rather than uh  jude law trying to get you all to just revert to the your childhood stage by spanking you abruptly on the bottom.

Absolutely so get wet thoughts on aoc and illinois twitch stream. I don't know if I have any uh. I'm just. I'm did any of them have have heated gamer moments. It seems to me like twitch a lot of people on twitch. A lot of young people better to have them seeing that than to see  holocaust simulator. I mean. I guess that's better than the alternative but it just it seemed like it. It launched it was the game that launched a thousand soy faces. I'll say that people were just soy facing horde over that uh. It's it's it's nice to have fun with with some of the better people who got upset about it. It's like come on.

It's like why why shouldn't you be yelling at nancy. Pelosi to he's like come on man come on. That's just like why is obama golfing so much stuff. It's like you're looking for something to get mad at. I did appreciate uh elon today retweeting jordan ol saying holy  about their own gaming skills. I also like that elon posted her rig specs yeah. She is cool she's pogba she's pogged out. I maybe it maybe it is a it's taking a live position but it is. It is okay to say that some congress people are in fact cool. Elon is is specifically cool. I think regardless of any question about you know the political project. She's just. She's pretty cool. I mean we met her for god's sake yeah. We met her and she was cool very cool and and more importantly she was nice specifically to us. That's the biggest thing right there. It's amazing how that helps it's like you know what uh this person I met and was nice to me. She's pretty great but you know. I think honestly being nice to me is a good reflection on other people frankly because I'm a delight people who don't like me in public. Uh honestly. It's usually a problem with them because I'm charming.

I'm a charming charming gentleman guys did you know that ad busters is still being made are you aware of this. You hear about this kevin yeah. About this. They're still making ad busters man in 2020. I mean this is like if they made a magazine for the japanese guys who stayed in the mountains in the in in the islands for 20 years after world war ii. I'm now just thinking of the the the lost ronin of gen gen x yep. Uh though those still uh you know maintaining the the poise that chain coffee is gonna destroy this this country like it's it's what it was was. It was it was the leftism of the end of history. It was like we were we did feel. There was no alternative so the only point of rebellion was the wrong. Aesthetics essentially like this society is commodified and it's just a reset. It was a resettling setting of like the one-dimensional man marcus critique of like the commodity of uh of the conformity of the fifties just like through the after synthesized further through the crucible of the sixties cultural revolution but look at this it got 20 1946. It's got a thanksgiving dinner a family around a table enjoying a wholesome meal that is proof of the work and love of people for one another 20 that's right eating damn. Mcdonald's at the frickin mcdonald's store eating freaking big macs that says so much about society here's another question. I think we should all be asking ourselves will high fashion suddenly look stupid or will our luxury fantasies and hyper individuality grow. Even more intense damn dude what do you get what do you got. I'm gonna go with uh intensification of family to go with intensification.

Yes okay. That'll be interesting. We'll see won't we. I'm looking at some of these pictures they're of hunks. There's a few hunks. I gotta say there's some hunks in here check out. These hugs. These are the hun. These are the anti-consumer hunks right here the babes of anti-consumerism yeah. Somehow some some some cheekbones on display right. Here okay see like it looks like a fashion magazine and you're like oh is this the latest fashion uh wrong. No. It's not because some of the letters are scratched out. It's been hacked. It's been ad busted. I gotta say though guys ad busting makes me feel good. I don't know about you if we got an hour. We're we're almost at an hour. I'm waiting to see if there's anything. Let's wrap it up shortly any more uh. Uh questions any more good ones ad busters but for balls you've been culture jammed. I'm afraid you have been culture jammed.


Here's a thing called the mental liberation front and it's got this thing. I didn't sign up for total surveillance. Yes this is detournment. This is so this is some detournment is this this shit's detorment as  uh let's maybe uh because we're talking about the debate a little in our plans for let's do a uh maybe just a quick debate preview. Somebody asked do you think trump will go all out at biden tomorrow since it's his last major appearance like what is that what is the end game uh. I got to assume that they've they're keeping him going on steroids. So he's going to be zort zooted and he's going to be the blood's going to be pumping um. He's going to be on that wanted. Just stiff this old man and apparently there's going to be a mute. Button is that what I heard yes it's going to be hugely affected and what's going to be very interesting to see is how trump reacts to that because that's a first that has never happened to him before and I and I don't know how he accommodates that if he's going to be able to stop himself from just charging into the red cape of the uh of the bullfighter well we shall see we shall see didn't. They didn't aren't that did. They also agree the last minute to make it just a foreign policy debate. He demanded that I don't know if they agreed all right because that that felt like a bit of a punt for him. He doesn't really want to talk about cohen. I'll say that and he does want to talk about ukraine specifically hunter and his crooked beat dealings sorry guys. Everyone likes hunter and everybody likes uh. What's his name but joe everyone likes joe biden too. He's just he's the opposite of hillary clinton. It's like this really does show we act like these things have some sort of logic to them like even if trump is an incoherent and and uh and frankly pathological uh political uh phenomenon. It's understandable. Uh is a rejection of clintonian uh obama-esque dlc centrism which holds no hope for anybody. But now.

It's four years later and the same. Centrism is being brought back out but because it's a genial old man instead of that harpy who frankly a lot of people didn't like some for good reasons. Some for genuinely sexist reasons. It's okay now in fact it's great and we love it. The there's the political system is so many  elections because people are voting off of the most obscure and mind-bending uh of rationales that collectively. I don't think add up to any kind of like desire on the part of a collective as much as sort of a collective expression of its sanity well. It's also that you know as you were just saying it's. It's you can much easier say that hillary lost 2016 than trump won it 100. I think that you will be able to say the same about this if it if it goes towards biden that it isn't as much that trump lost it. That biden won the election 100. We'll see if that pans out who who knows how the these totals and and splits are going to go. Maybe. There is a huge surge in democratic turnout and he's you know but even that is something to argue that it's all just polarization against trump that peop people are showing up in huge droves not to vote for joe biden but to vote against donald trump. There's no way that biden can be the source for any of this one way or the other. Even if you see a massive title wave of an election it will not be because of biden which is the way they want it.

They want it to be about trump because that means anything they do is by definition good because it's not trump doing it and hey if you think it's not good enough. Do you want trump to do it because he's there he's waiting in the wings him and his followers if not him. The next version there'll always be someone there to discipline you away from criticizing or falling away from the democratic project yeah and the worse. It gets the more you can be chastised. Indeed it touches but it you know I mean. I don't want to draw this out too long. We should sign up soon but it is just interesting to see how that dynamic plays out of like being like trying to position ourselves as like it's not going to be good but we the democrats are this bulwark against some kind of incipient fascism that will roll over us like a tide from an unleashed dam. If you don't vote for us coupled with what you're already seeing and you this.

This has been uptick just even in the last two weeks so much of the attitude of man. I can't wait to go back to not paying attention to you yeah thinking about it even though all the things all the bad things are only getting worse and on a fast accelerated timetable and the need for people to be activated against them in some way and by being activated. Find a way are instead going to retreat even further into fantasy in fact just another realm of fantasy where they get to disconnect from their imagined connection to politics whatsoever because oh my god that whole time they were freaking out about trump they could have logged off they could have stopped caring. They didn't because they enjoyed it because they got it got their  rocks off and defending biden against the blood tie that he's about to unleash is not going to get the rocks off so they'll just care about something else which is exactly why I've signed off from from the time being for listening to pod save america. But I can't wait to start listening again if after a biden victory because I can't wait to see how they're trying to engage their crowd of people who have they've been corralling this entire time being like we absolutely like you have to stay engaged. We absolutely must work is forever you are you are a soldier in the army of democracies and that's also their success is b as being that I can't the one thing that. I have I think that might come the only positive. I see coming out of this is that I think and I hope that that phenomenon will be less prevalent on the actual left and that the actual left is now will be in fact engaged to like to compel now to engage this new reality of this democratic. This feckless democratic hunger chancellorship and that will power them against an opponent that will be demobilized.

That's the uh that's the hope yeah. I mean. I don't want. It is it gonna happen. I don't know but it could it's a lot. It's realistic. It's not. It's not pie in the sky. It's just it comes down to a lot of other factors but I could definitely see the failure. The immediate failure of the biden campaign to do anything other than whatever your worst nightmares of it were going to be not driving people to move forward because even if they're doing it. Libidinally they're their libidin libido has already been jazzed by the fight and by the defeat they're already like committed to it. So it's like. It's just a further you know s stab to the groin whereas for the liberal when you've made it your architecture that like democratic uh uh rule is by definition. Uh you know uh uh peace and justice and an ideal state. The closest thing to a panglossian best of all possible worlds then how can you keep caring yeah. So. I think that's hope yeah. It's not a lot. It's a thin read but the only reads we have are pretty thin at this point.

I'll leave you guys with this. I just took this off of my jacket uh. These just came in the mail. Today. They're demo mock-ups for some new chapeau uh pins lapel or you know little pins. You can put on your shirts or backpacks or something and these will be on sale soon and they look really sick and they're nice and uh uh heavy good metal and everything um so yeah looking forward to that uh anyway. Uh should we sign off matt yeah. Let's do it all right. I'm going to throw in a song but uh say goodbye matt bye-bye matt.
