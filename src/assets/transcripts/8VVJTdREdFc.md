Ah did it finally go did it finally go. I think I might have finally gone. Although I'm seeing critters. Yeah there we go. I'm very sorry to free up the critters. I know we all love. The critters folks. They're delightful. They're friends. They're they're gentle creatures of the forest deep and we all wish. We could crawl up with them daily. But sadly we must spend our days with much less agreeable. Mammals namely sparking human beings whose brains have been filled with poison. Oh. No I did pet a horse in the snow. When I was canvassing for bernie in new hampshire. It was out in the country and there was a house that had a paddock next to it and there was a horse out. There. There was nobody home but I got to cut the horse and that was nice they're fun. They got those big gigantic eyes. Yeah. Horses are nice chill dudes chill dudettes.

Oh the volume is super low h well. At this point there's nothing I can do about it so. I'm just accepting that you can hear it or not. And if you can't hear it well maybe you weren't meant to hear it. Maybe hearing it would be bad for you. Maybe there are forbidden truths that you're not ready to absorb and as a result this it's like the world spirit. Awa herself is blocking the audio quality and making it so that you can't hear these. These things that would break your mind and send you off into a spiral of self-destruction and destruction of others. In fact you could say that the variable volume is is the thing that saved your life so so be be thankful be thankful as you are for all things. I did finish out too with gentleman.

Last episode was phenomenal. The whole thing was brilliant and I watched some of his videos on video and it's very interesting to see his like style change over time as he kind of refines what he's doing because like the earlier stuff is much cruder and it's like in its comedy and also in its overall like point of view time is is a necessary ingredient for art. So he says that moralistic fables can be good like avatar if the ma if the moral is good. I mean that's half of it. The other half is it has to be told well and the thing I would say to anyone who says that avatar isn't. A good movie in any respect is that if you could tell me that you were sitting there watching those scenes where they're flying on the back of the dragon thing the big battle. I mean think of what combat and action scenes are like in current movies. Big movies michael bay christopher nolan. All the marvel think of what those zack snyders think about what those action scenes look like big battle scenes. They are largely incomprehensible pixelated explosions of I can't sort it out what am. I supposed to do literally decontextualized and that are edited into a total haphazard slot. Generally. I mean if you like tristan vernon movies you don't really like the action scenes right like you like the puzzle box stuff you like the clever things how many action scenes are in. Nolan's like repertoire of you know great moments cinematically maybe the hallway fight in inception but that's not really about the action that's about the special. That's about the specific like dimensions. Although you know even there it's not shot particularly interestingly or like emotionally you watch the like the big clagmatic battle scene. In avatar.

He sets up spatial relationships so you know where everything is where the where the the people are where the ships are. Then he has them engage in battle and every shot builds a little narrative within the battle whereas modern action is kind of built around the premise of disorientation and while you might say that's good in its own way. One thing it doesn't do is build investment in it. As a piece of narrative. It doesn't tell a story a story not the story but a story within the story and cameron's action tells stories within stories so his moral. His simplistic disney moral is wedded to technical technical genius somebody who says yeah thank you that anyone.

The reason somebody said sort out your audio mate and it triggered me because british people. I am done with. I'm done with hearing anything from british people. They're about to just blow themselves up and sink into the north atlantic on purpose because they are too be a functioning country. They had a guy who was standing there in front of them and saying hey you press a button in a goddamn voting booth and they couldn't be asked to do it. Instead they would rather riddance after um after birthing this monstrosity after birthing global capitalism and then being left bereft. After The your kid ran away ran across the water seek its fortune in the west and now you're just the sad pathetic gutted emptied shell. Now you're going to die like an octopus that has released their spores. Even though you didn't have to you could have had some dignity and no one can say that they did not have every chance to go a different direction. They had one of the only decent people that hideous island has produced jeremy corbyn telling them every day to their face that it doesn't have to be this way and the miserable. Bog monsters decided ah no he's not he's lying it can't be real. It's a trap because I if everyone around here is like me and I am so awful and miserable and shitty and and pale and and grotesque and and and nasty and and disconnected and anti-social well.

Then none of us could ever get together on anything why not just go down pretending. It's the blitz again getting national cohe like basically what what what brexit was is. This is an attempt by the british people to regain a moment that they all think they actually cared about one another and that was world war ii. That was the that was the emergency that was the keep calm and carry on moment when they had meaning in life because they had an understanding of themselves that went beyond their individuality. They were part of a of a country that was under attack from evil and that was fighting it and found and their struggle and sacrifice.

In that context had a virtue and they want it again. That's why they're jacking off at the idea about all the food they won't be able to eat now. They're gonna have to do victory gardens and stuff and ration potatoes because they need to get that back because they can't imagine any other way to get it even though jeremy corbyn was standing there right there hey if you guys want to have like national sense of purpose and mission. We don't have to do austerity to ourselves masochistically. You repressed victorian freaks how about we create a actual politic actual. We turn this country out and we we take it from being a business enterprise and turn it into a country. An actual like civic project a civic project of governance and a civic project of of um of improvement rather than just a civic project of dour withstanding of of of pain a dour endurement of of because because they can amen because that's conceivable to them because national unity through austerity is conceivable because in that case you're operating out of hate fear you're operating out of fear you're operating afraid of something being worse yes huddling underneath the tube waiting to get blown up yes cutting a bean into three pieces like in a concentration camps on the thames but here and now corbin's not anti-austerity pledge for national purpose that was appealing to the idea of love the idea of getting doing something better and they can't imagine that because they don't love anybody including themselves and of course.

It's not like we're much better than that. They're just further along in this process of alienating themselves for the world because they started before we did and there's fewer of them which means that it intensifies like the generational pathogens just multiply over time and so they're just all so miserable that they can only operate off of. They can only be. They can only be socially They can. They imagine that they can only be socially um by a fear of punishment of some kind in the form of well. All right austerity britain sucks but it's better than becoming you know a completely polish. Denatured capital. Dissolved department of europe which will be miserable in a different and worse way. Those are horrors beyond imagining whereas I can imagine what it would be like to have to to to have a victory garden. My grandpa talks about it and he talks about how everybody was happier back. Then we're going to make it happen again and they said. I had the chance they had the signpost. They said no thank you we're too traumatized by our own. We've been too defeated by victory because all of this stems from the fact that these are the monsters who destroyed the world. These are the monsters who set out more than anyone.

They were the most successful ones anyway among the europeans the ones who set out to subdue the world and to turn it and to turn everything in it away from everything else and towards itself they started it. Their culture has been molded and and and completely driven around that central premise. Since the dawn of capitalism and now they find themselves a husk where they don't even have the am. The they have lost for many more years than us the dream of plenty that we were able to sustain because of the fantasy first of our western expansion and then the global bounty of the post-war dominance that we enjoyed the the empire that we held before before the borders closed off and before the myth lost its potency before we had to turn back inward and try to find a way to deal with one another having no having to develop no social bonds in like 40 years having generated no social trust in 40 years well. It's been a lot longer for the brits so you can't as with anything you can't blame them. But I sure as don't have to listen to them condescending to me with their goddamn fancy accents and they're dumb slang calling me their mate. I'm not your. Mate and of course americans can't get too cocky because we're right behind them.

We are right behind them because you know we have more. We have more loot to to burn through before we get to the mexican standoff but it will be very interesting to see how much self-inflicted damage will come from this just because of the refusal to have any faith in each other and maybe it couldn't have been any other way maybe they're too far gone. Maybe bur maybe. Corbin was like this thing that only could come into being. He could only be the guy like he could only be the guy because he was never a real threat and if you think about it that is in technical terms. What happened because corbin was only nominated was only put in as a name from leadership after ca.

 after miliband ate which you know he was against the entire time and watched his party do from the back bench hey and he stuck around and he was. He was there you know to not to to put you know blair brown in there real good sport. Let's give him a little shot h a little talk. Let's give him a little fun time. It was like a make-a-wish moment. It was like remember bat. Kid is anybody old enough now to remember bat kid when that little like kid by the way is. He dead did that kid die or is he in remission because honestly if he doesn't die. That's kind of ridiculous what they did for a kid who was just like you know basically just in the hospital. I mean stuff but anyway it was little make-a-wish thing from the labor front bench and then what happened is is that oh you know the the loss had sort of shaken. Things loose enough that people were interested in a new thing and as soon as as soon as that became something that was on the menu. All these labor members remember these are people who don't just vote in primaries. They are members which means that their relationship to the party is much different than the relationship of american liberals and leftists or whatever voters and the democratic party and so he caught on. But he caught on in a context where he was only allowed to be an option because of the fundamentals hegemonic rule of the new labor. Leadership and then the proof of that can be found in that even when he won the the the spot he was never able to actually have control of the party as we now know at every level. He was explicitly sabotaged by people and was not and either because he was too much of a softy or they didn't have enough leverage and that might if if if it's leverage point then this was never going to work they did not purge the party they did not purge and get rid of all these time servers. They didn't clear the ogen stables of blairites and once they didn't do that they were basically.

Now they might have lost anyway because of the way the entire you know media. Apparatus organized against them that might have been tough and brexit was there to be the wedge on behalf of reaction um but that inability to actually have your party operating on your behalf. That meant he was never going to be able to mount a real challenge and maybe that's because they knew at a basic like basal level that even if you let them in you'll take care of them and if that's the case it's it born. Corbin was always just sort of this like last burn off of xx. Democratic vision. Like he was the last gashes output of the last little pocket of like human feeling on the continent or on that island on that accursed land like the last bit of human felt communal identity that transcended the personal it. Just that's being like burned out of all society by the drive train of capitalism and alienation and this was as as like we near the final and total alienation of britain there's and then final perhaps destruction literal dismemberment due to a no deal brexit. A suicidal act of the end of the this is the dmt. The corbin was the dmt basically the last spiritual sigh of the collective humanity of britain before the death rattle kicked in. Now of course that means we are on that trajectory and maybe bernie was that with us. But maybe we have a few more maybe. There's a few more maybe there's a few more boxes to open maybe. A few more cats are alive than we currently think no way of knowing but you can see the trajectory you certainly can see the trajectory and I do wonder what the brits are going to do because this looks like it's going to be something in the middle of covet. I mean my god. This thing was supposed to be a disaster to do it in the middle of covet my god and I will say also that I i know there was a left case for brexit and I know that corbin was a brexiter and well.

He should have been like like if brexit hadn't happened and corbyn had been been able to become prime minister of a left-wing labor government. He probably would have pursued some sort of brexit from the left and it would have been a good idea and so there's a critique of of corbyn that he did not just embrace a left brexit from the beginning and the problem is that is that if you do that you do lose your right flank completely like they flee to to the lib dems and make it impossible for you for you probably to govern because they just got out of a coalition with the tories. They would go back into one in a heartbeat by literally joining them if they could like get into positions of power within the party which they certainly would because they were they'd be holding. The wit pan there um and you know you could argue it wouldn't have mattered. They would have been able to sweep them in. They would have been able to combine like the working-class tory voter pool and the entire working-class labor voting pool and the scots bring the scots back from the snp and they would have swamped them.

But it was a real concern and that's because at the nexus of liberals and leftists at the nexus of right and left labor members on the issue of brexit was how far can we go in letting this happen without being irresponsible because there was this understanding that brexit would be bad materially for the people who live in britain. In fact it would not it would it's not something to be reckless about and the left position was don't let them up and like these politics can be finessed by not finessing them and there was that there was that whisper in the ear that like labor had to stay away from pushing over the coke machine to to brexit out of like a general need to preserve you know basic integrity of the british economic system and it was always theoretical because what was going to happen in brexit is unknown and everybody had a personally emotionally invested subconscious bias on how much to take it seriously. Like the more of a lib. You were the more seriously you took the like objective economic argument about what would happen if brexit was Got went through the more you wanted to just say and go around it and just embrace the left brexit even though that meant in practice doing a of a tory brexit because that's the I that's the thing is that you're not you're probably going to be doing a tory brexit then because they're the ones who initiated it and that's where the the that's where the center of gravity of support for brexit was was. In the late. It was in the conservative party and that and that it broke against demographic currents that you need to keep together as a left-wing party and you don't want to fracture them. So it was a live question but it was invested with which with your your material preferences like that was guiding you more than you even knew when you were deciding how seriously to take the threat of brexit to the economy and to the livelihood of people in britain and I guess we're gonna find out going to find out how much of it was was propaganda and how much of it was real yeah. That's the thing is that is that the even though labor could have gotten a huge percentage of voters with a with a left brexit position and they would have eaten into some of the tory working-class vote.

Brand loyalty is such traditional voting patterns and like social bonds are such racial understanding and things like that are such that you wouldn't get all of them or maybe. Even most of them you might only get a small fraction. Meanwhile everybody who already votes lib dem which is not insubstantial plus what what percentage of the labor vote would have voted for the lib dems. In that situation. It's got to be at least 25 right and if it's 25 that would almost guarantee a coalition between like. There was with cameron and nick lund or whatever the it. We'll we'll be legends and be left brexit. But the thing that made it so slippery is that it all hinged on a premise that couldn't be confirmed like what is brexit really is it a boogeyman or is it a is it an apocalypse. I mean it's probably not going to be either. But it's going to be closer to one than to the other. We might actually find out oh. It might it bloody chad nick me moby michael tracy watches the streams really.

How do you know are you michael drosy oh he need me bleed. My boo addicted my isabel. It's bloody. It's amazing. It's nickname. They need it.

I think people all say honestly though people say um like oh the brits are gonna lose lose the united kingdom. Those idiots think about it this way though so presumably if you did get some sort of complete dissolution of the united kingdom barring in the context of just complete economic collapse. I mean you know a managed transition a velvet revolution type thing who would be mad obviously the scots would not be mad. The welsh wouldn't be mad. Some of the northern irish would be mad but it wouldn't be the uk's problem anymore that would be the irish's problem good luck with that dublin which by the way is one reason that I really don't think that they're that that excited about the prospect of of reunification in the halls of power in the republic because all of a sudden you would have to deal with one integrating a The most economically depressed part of ireland into your economy which is much smaller in general than britain's is and deal with this now active restive not quite majority anymore but like 50 percent of the population and you might say okay you know maybe. Only a third of them are still really. You know poker up the ass unionists but that's still enough to mean you're going to get some version of the troubles pop up again with the reverse with the powers reversed but and you know it.

I don't think it would necessarily be anywhere near as intense as the last one but is it a really headache. You want when everything's basically the same. The main difference is the colors of the post boxes but again brexit comes in that changes the calculus and then what about the english is what I say what about the english won't. They be sad that they lost their empire. No they'll be relieved they get to be england being being. British only had meaning when it felt like it was part of a project of greatness of expansion of at least prestige but in like crisis you know eu conditions. England essentially had a nervous breakdown because remember england is the only part of the uk that voted for leave and it's where labor lost was in england because they essentially pulled the pin on the united kingdom themselves. Because these these are vestiges these appendages those these pissed off scottish people who want to like act like they're not us like they didn't do the welshman with their dumb fake language getting oppressed when you call them a sheep. It's what's the point of this why don't just be england again. Get quiet feel just be alone with our thoughts as good english people and not have to worry about these. So yeah. I'd say everybody would be happy with a breakup except for the ulster scots of course they're going to be very mad katie bar. The door ah yeah does that do did any uk or irish people in the chat want.

Us want to pop up with some like more informed ideas of what that would look like like if there was a reunification because I could totally see it because you would not if if they voted do we to do to this new situation with the eu do we do with and the border being reestablished breaking the good friday agreement and like essentially ripping up the document that had prevented war from breaking out for the past 25 years now or 30 years. 25. Um if that's going to be the new order it would make more economic sense. It would make better sense for my family to rejoin the republic. You got basically all the all the catholics are going to say that and at this point that's what 45 almost 50 percent. They're nearing parity because they outbreed the protestant but then among the pro but then among the protestants among younger people who didn't grow up in the furnace of the of the troubles. The desire to you know have a functioning economy and and ease of age of movement and stuff like that will be more than whatever vestigial relationship.

They had to the union leaving only sort of the most you know unreconstructed paisleyite which so that's what 25 of the population what would they do like obviously the army lights are coming out again. They're not going to just take that line down but like how far do they go is. It is it like tea party. They just march around with ars like and then just do random like violence or do they do they like go to go to war but the thing is they're mostly drug gangs now like like all those all the unionist paramilitaries they're still around. But they are um. They're completely dedicated since. I mean you know it's like they they they they demobilized the the war with the ira because you know they they had essentially agreed to sublimate their conflict into politics so they they didn't the but the so they didn't really need to exist anymore. The ira needed to exist because they were the loser in in the sense that they didn't kick the brits out. The brits are still there so they did not get their ultimate aim so they had to keep the weapons they had to keep the organization going. The paramilitaries had no reason to exist except for the fact that they were already by that point selling a shitload of are right now the the people who sell heroin in northern ireland. If they change the color of the mailboxes do. They give. A enough to give up that life again.

I don't know what do people think what's up with armenian irish by john well a pretty astounding monstrous monstrous It's more war crimes from turkey. It's more war crimes from our from our nato ally which we look the other way while they ethnically cleanse northern syria and now they're doing it in nagorno with the azires it's and they're Essentially I gotta believe that it's some sort of deal with russia. I'm assuming that on some other point in the geopolitical map and maybe libya would be a place. Putin is like has an interest greater than his strategic interest in armenia which erdogan was able to to arbitrage by saying hey. I will give you this because it doesn't matter as much to me as armenia does and so putin says sure because by his calculus he's losing less than he's getting but by erdogan's point of view whatever he's losing whether it's in libya or with the shale oil they're trying to drill off of cyprus. He is much more interested in getting back some of that territory from armenia and so it's so the exchange happened.

The stately continued the dirty game of diplomacy at another round and it's monstrous. It's it's hideous. It's orbiting they're chopping off old men's heads and putting it on tick tock I don't know what. I don't what what much else to say about it. I mean the fact that it's not on the news and the way that syrian civil war is tells you a lot if you didn't already know but you should probably know by now oh yes yes. This is the series the azires like they would do anything because armenia is a regional al um. Romania is a regional ally to russia which is right there. I think azerbaijan is going to pick a fight at that that close to russia without backup guaranteed back up from turkey which was immediately supplied that's the context that the whole thing takes place in you can't remove that and act like oh. It's not turkey off because azir azerbaijan doesn't choose doesn't get to choose whether or not to go into naragon. Everyone gets to choose therefore. It's because of turkey tell me how I'm wrong. Now you might have a situation where somebody overextends themselves and you have to go in. But that's not what happened here. That's sure not what happened here. This is a calculated escalation to see what they can get. They got noragoro because putin had other interests that were greater or as a karabok. I have no idea. I really don't know much about it.

Just the broad strokes critical support for the armenians of course. I mean I think that's yeah because some of these get tough you know if you want to do the campus thing of picking like okay who's on the anti-imperial side. But this one's a pretty easy one especially when you see what what they're doing in the places that they've conquered like they're doing ethnic cleansing they're they're they're pulling off the like. The armenian writing off of churches to claim that they're actually old mosques. They were mosques first so they could do the hagia sophia thing and chopping people's heads off and so anyway does anybody have an idea how how how what kind of action would you give on the the udf showing up like you're going to do bombs again. They're going to like do or just like maybe like shoot up a chip shop or you're gonna.

See like a coordinated uprising. My gut tells me a couple of showpiece old-school car bombs like the one they did in dublin. Some people don't know this but the the deadliest bombing of the troubles did not happen in northern ireland or in england. It happened in dublin when the uvf took a truck down in the middle of the of the the town middle of lake mcconnell street o'connell street and detonated it without calling in a warning beforehand which the ira did as a standard operating procedure. Once again you know you can always say another man's terrorist is a dice streeter fighter but sometimes you can tell who the good guys and bad guys are in these things broadly speaking. They just drove the thing in there and let it blow up and kill as many people as possible. They'd do a more a couple of those for sure. But I don't think they do much more than that because well for what at this point. None of this stuff has any. I don't know what I have to say.

I have no idea. The thing you have to remember is that the the current situation is such that like the the remaining structure of these paramilitaries are sustained by their relationships with the political structure both at stormont and the power sharing government which until recently replaced rule from westminster Although I think it's been suspended for years now which is another thing that's going to contribute and is contributing to a likely crisis around brexit that they literally haven't had home rule for like two years now three since before brexit and then of course with the british government which has coordinated with them the whole time and used them as the cat's paw for extra legal assassinations and murders and bombings. All it was essentially It was essentially celtic gladio. It was it was a nato member using local criminal fascist elements to carry on a war against the left and they would essentially be cut off in this situation because I don't think the english are going to care enough to like you know take u-boats full of full of enfield rifles to the ports of northern ireland so that they can keep these guys fighting the irish because they don't care the english don't care. They haven't cared for years so without that backing and the fact that they're basically a bunch of dumbass old smack dealers.

I don't think they have a lot in them. There would be an exodus that's the big thing like a lot of the most hardcore guys would just leave. They'd go to england although it'd be funny if brexit made it harder for them to get to get citizenship ah. I'm. I've I've always been a I've always been a student of the trouble specifically um. I had a college class about nationalism and and um and it was all through the prism of the the northern irish questions. So it was like one of the first like historical and political puzzles. I ever encountered in college so and I've been there. I've been ireland a number of times and it's got a great and it's also you know as you learn more about.

It's got a great revolutionary tradition. I mean you got so many different movements and and formations of resistance and leaders you got like the white boys and the jaw off to try to avoid capture by the english at the rising of the moon at the rising of the moon and arrive the voice for freedom at the horizon of the moon and then of course you've got one of the goats. One of the early one of the great figures of of the early communist labor movement. James connolly who is a kind of an irish lincoln in that any system where any any world where the post-war republic doesn't descend into stagnant The catholic quasi-feudal theocracy. James connolly does not get murked because there was really nobody to follow in his footsteps and even though the citizens army that he'd founded did most of the heavy lifting during the easter rising.

The the the ira that came later just had a much more deluded labor prerogative and by the end of the war it all got kind of stamped out of it and all you got left is. Blue shirts oh man michael collins the big fella. I mean a certified pimp one of your great insurgency geniuses. You know a guy who you want to fight a asymmetrical war which hats off to them because they kind of had to make it up as they went along but um he the dog during the negotiations with churchill. I think at the end of the day he just fell for a bluff I think they could have pushed it farther because I don't think that churchill knew is they churchill didn't know how bad they really will we're off But the thing is is that I don't think collins knew how little the english at the end of the day really cared like they cared because you know they had that big presence especially in all-stars. Like there was the prestige of the empire and all that but I mean at the end of the day. I think you like he just didn't have the the confidence so like he looked. He looked churchill in the eyes and he just he blinked first and that's usually how these things end up going. It's like a lot of these historic decisions. The the friction ends up depending on how the turn of a coin is between individuals. Individual decisions and moments or you know the collection of those rebounding on top of one another.

But one way or another you went home with an unviable document which of course. The frustrating thing is is that what they ended up settling for anyway. None of it was none of the fighting was meant anything but nobody knew that at the time because like so many things were bound up you know like it was the left-wing position to reject the to reject the treaty. But at the same time the specific question ended up being beside the point and the fact that that's the what the civil war ended up being. I think the fact that the civil war in ireland ended up being about a formal question that ended up meaning nothing in the long run ended up ensuring that their post-war politics were gonna be what they ended up being literally non-ideological contests between the remaining sides of that war. Like after the civil war in the united states that held for a little bit you know it was just regional. The southerners were democrats northerners republicans but the the fact that the war had been about some enduring question of you know means of production for example and and or methods of production like so like so political economy questions that inflected those those divisions and then the irish civil war ended up being about an abstract principle of whether or not we signed this treaty and we we have this arrangement with britain and yes you can say things flowed from it but that was the inciting thing the way the civil war was around slavery and it meant that in the aftermath of the war as the necessity of the question receded from view. All that's left is just the echo of the sides you were on and you can't say well and and well. I understand why left-wing forces resisted the treaty look at the remnant of the pro-treaty of the anti-treaty side. It was the blue shirts. It was the closest thing that ireland had to a fascism.

It was the energy of that working-class movement fatally fused to nationalism because the fight had been over a national question so they turned into these freaky little catholic integralist goose steppers who went to spain to fight for franco. Those were the only significant force of foreign volunteers that franco got other than you know hired. Moroccan mercenaries was and and you know enlisted men from italy and germany who claimed to be volunteers. Were these who came over there. Nobody knew what to do with them and they ended up getting shot up in a friendly fire incident and then sent home. That's why nationalism is bad folks. That's why it has it has to be dealt with.

But it should never be organized as a principle an emotional or like conceptual principle to organize around it is an obstacle that means that doesn't mean you can ignore it. It has to always be engaged with but not on terms of friendliness as an enemy engaged as an enemy and of course. You can say that you know the the national question is different in a colonial context like ireland was and it is different. But it still colors the emergence of like the political struggle to come from the the class conflict and it if it's not neutralized it will take over it will it will wipe out everything else capital. It will fuse itself with capital again like english capital will just change this the flag of convenience to the tri-color to the red green and the green white and orange and then come in and keep dropping your.

Blind and that's what happened and then they have the class of priests to keep everybody nice and docile and keep everybody just cow-eyed and indolent. Like the worst the worst parody of what 19th century know nothing said about what catholic democracy would look like you know isn't that funny like like the know. Nothing said we can't let the catholics into this country and we can't let them vote because they will turn our country into a priest plagued.

 medieval bog. We will all be in the thrall of of cardinals and landowners or and and thrown into like a druidic superstitious age of darkness and the irish. Once they kicked out. The british made that literal thing and it's because the working class had been destroyed because the working-class energies emerging from the class conflict that drove the national conflict were spent and wasted in this feudal national crusade. James larkin btfo sadly but the reason the know-nothings were wrong is that they weren't coming into some like traumatized post-colonial situation. They were being assimilated into a into a capitalistic machinery of alienation which prevents the exact kind of priest bespoke and medieval superstitious miasma that the catholics recreated in ireland like that's part of like.

America's vastness and america's polyglot nature is one of the machineries that demystified europe it pulled us all it pulled europe through like through through a mesh screen and brought it out the other side like like gerald general ford henry ford used to hold pageants at his factories because he employed a lot of immigrants and he wanted to make sure that they all became good americans so he would pay. He had he had them all take on his dime. English classes so and and etiquette classes and like civics lessons and then they would have graduation ceremonies where they would appear on state. Their families were in the audience they would appear on stage in the native garb of wherever they came from. They would go up a upstairs to a on the top of a slide and at the base of a slide was a big melt pot and it said melting pot on it and they would come down the slide. They would emerge from behind the big cutout pot wearing a suit and then they would all stand there in the suits and get and they would be clapped like it was a ritual of induction into america and the thing about that is that's basically what america did. That pageant is is an expression of the the way that that the alienated subject of american capitalism is acculturated within one or two within a few generations of coming to america into a social relationship that me that is essentially secular and that didn't happen in ireland.

They never got the industrial revolution. They went right from feudalism to to neoliberalism neoliberal effect capitalism. They missed the industrial development stage completely which is why now they have the economy of a caribbean tax. Haven the economic base of ireland is the same as like aruba or or um the caymans it's laundering money. Ireland does have an empire what do you call the united states. Australia. New zealand can canada although I guess that's more scotland. I would argue that the mick the irish catholic is the brain of the united states like if you're going to get abstract and say like of all the different currents of of all the different currents of immigration that came to this country from all over the world where did their what was their cultural impact like at what level are. They you know affecting the rule the the exercise of political and cultural power and I would say that you know most of the we. We are mostly peasant refuse from one place or another to people. Someone else didn't want either because we were excess mouths from the from europe from the european agricultural economy or from africa.

If we were defeated tribal enemies who were sold away sold as you know to in return for for for produce from those very agricultural lands. We are the refuse and then and then we sort along geographic lines and then we reproduce it and like some people go and fill the interior. Some people hung the coasts and the people who on the coast usually because of when they got there like all the good land closest to the early settlements was taken by the time the irish really started showing up and and by the time the west was fully opened to like a genuine expansion beyond just like the reach of the of the appalachians like when the west was like lake. Michigan that was the west and the west opened up completely. By that point.

 it was others by that point the irish had fixed themselves so deeply into the places. They stuck those east northeastern cities that that was where subsequent generations came because that's where they knew they could get a community that's where they knew they could operate that's where they had some sort of familiarity. That's where they could because they didn't have anything. They couldn't come come to america slap down five ship. Shillings and buy a conestoga wagon and go claim land in the west like the little the way that a lot of like english and then later german immigrants could do you know. I saved up all of my my my my grape harvest this year and I got three big double eagles with the kite with the the king of bavaria's face on them and now. I'm gonna go to america and I'm gonna buy a shores of america. They clung to the coast which means they were there to fill in those civil society roles like that that needed to be filled as as the the cities became more more socially complex.

Police officers local politicians. Figures both of public service and administration. Someone had to do those jobs and they were there to do them and they were the first pmc. First professional managerial class were the irish immigrants who filled the fire stations and police stations of of the eastern cities that became the center places of american like cultural production. Even as we were producing capital elsewhere and we were spreading out across the country It was all being directed east for that's being equalized and like the political story of the last 40 years is the political story of that being equalized. But it started and stayed there and so the irish they're deep in. There.

They're like they're like a brain stemming. They haven't they're in everything is kind of filtered through them and then you've got you know of course. The american ashkenazi jews fit a very similar role and a higher level of the pmc because of their later appearance and their relative diversity of income because like jews of all economic strike moved to the united states all number of pennies to rub together moved to the united states whereas only the poorest irish except for the one you know who were literally too portable for the ticket came to the united states. At least they came in the the much larger percentages of them because like you got all of the like if there's a if there's a pogrom and there's a huge push or there's a huge conscription effort.

In the tsar's army. You got all those jews or you got like a stretch or you got a section of all of them. You got the vast majority of of the of the of the immigrants from ireland of the 19th century were of the lowest material circumstance which means they came to the city and they had to get a job quick and that's one of the reasons that we care so much about all that. And and how the ira was able to largely fund a what 30-year war with the crown through donations from a plastic patty sitting around bars in boston and chicago. I love that steve king who was a reactionary like in every so in every in every way your like typical from marble um. Ulster protestant you know like just a ramrod reactionary psycho who fetishizes hierarchy and state violence. But because he grew up around a bunch of weepy mix. He says yeah these socialist. The these guys trying to overthrow like the british control of ireland so that they can institute a a a marxist communist government. I'm going to funnel mill millions of dollars to them by having like having fun trying to think of an irish guy gabriel byrne at a a potato eating contest potato eating contest.

Oh they denied the kraken got denied oh. No oh wow the thing that we all knew was gonna. Happen happened damn well hearing that damn. It oh. I can't do it. I was gonna do it all right. You know what I'll say it instead. I don't think you can get in trouble for saying something. I was gonna play it but twitch has gotten psycho about about dc thing so. I can't play it but apropos of trumpy getting murked and um and what we've been talking about let me just sing the cattle stand by the house and the yanks they were within and the tiger boys with his three more man of the usa.

Oh another good one was ribbonism. They used to wear ribbons and then go and like cave in the heads of landlords. There's this movie called black 47 that's on netflix and it's really funny because it's like in one respect. You can see why someone could say. It's terrible and hate it but I kind of respect it conceptually. It's a drama of the of the irish potato famine and the story is essentially a it's. The whole thing is designed to be like a school child lesson. In all the terrible things the english did. It was like sitting down at baby. It's like sitting the kid down and being like hey do you want to know about the irish potato famine. I could explain it to you. I could write it down but I could just make you sit and watch this for 90 minutes and then after having watched it. You will get it and that means that it's sort of comical how on the nose. It is like every single facet of like english colonial rule in ireland during the famine is totally is all happens. Like everybody.

It all occurs every element of it like the fact that they were a net exporter of food the whole time because the the vast lands of the were being held by the absentee landlords to produce food for export and that you know that there was transportation for minor crimes to australia. There were mass evictions from lands where the like people who weren't dying were living because landlords were wanted to turn um that it was more profitable during that period. When there was low agricultural prices. It was more profitable to turn farmland into grazing land for sheep. So you didn't need. Tenants you could turn that land in the pasture so they just kicked them off. Like all these things are in there and and all those things is create. This story of just unrelenting hilariously miserable horror for this family. Like this guy comes back this irish guy in the midst of the of the of the famine comes home to his family. They benefit from he's deserted from the app from the army in afghanistan. His family's dead somebody gets murdered by a by a lamp. A agent of the landlord is trying to evict them and then he just goes like he goes psycho mode. He decides to just be a terminator of english colonialism. He just starts taking everybody responsible for every element of misery in ireland up to and then finally culminating in the english land owner.

 is he. Murks and it's not good in the sense that it is not very subtle. It's not very hard to predict if their characters are very thin but its ability to just embody literally an entire sort of con historical truth and just pack it all into one thing like a just a big gumball that you can chew on for a while and like you get something. I was like damn. This has I i mean. I don't know like is this value purely didactic or is there something impressively artistic about it. I don't know or maybe the whole thing is actually a a parody like. It's like there's a lot of people who theorize that titus andronicus was shakespeare's parody of jacobian bloody jacoby and revenge theater like the blockbuster cinema of the time where it was all just people murdering each other and that was his satire of it. This is like a satire of the irish catalog woe you know all the songs that you're supposed to sing about how the english came and burned my land and I couldn't need a gravity to turn up oh the fields of athenry where once I watched the sleepers fly. So it could just also just operate as a funny funny parody either way. It's it's if nothing else you'll learn something all right. I'm out of here guys bye.
