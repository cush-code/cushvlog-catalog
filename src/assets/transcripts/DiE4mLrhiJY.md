Baby. I was born this way baby. I was born this way. I'll never thought you got that brother I wanna try baby. Are we live. We're live. I better post. This now there's me look at me hello. Hi matt hello. How's it going guys. I don't have anything playing today. I thought I'd just do a chill stream talk you guys. But whatever you want to talk about while drinking chocolate milk. Don't tell me there's no sound tell me. I have sound right okay. We have sound good oh. They hear the milk that's good.

It looks like they've had unemployment expire that's pretty crazy. I mean the thing is the reason. I just assume that that's going to be corrected at some point is just because I don't see the percentage in continuing to do it from the perspective of people in power forgetting the political parties of actual power holders so unless this is the end and they're like getting ready to I don't know just put people in fema camps. I don't really get the percentage but I i don't know somebody said I was being smug about it and if I was I apologize. I understand people's livelihoods. They're at stake here and they're terrified and they have every reason to be worried about this. I'm sorry if I appeared to not really have enough empathy for that position because obviously it's horrible.

I think what they're going to have to learn is just that their premise that like you can't have people on unemployment because it's going to prevent them from seeking work. I think they just don't get that the jobs don't exist. I think that they're I think that they are trapped in a illusion about how bad things are and how badly they've injured. How badly the economy has been structurally undermined by this that they think that they're still are. They that disconnected and ignorant yeah. I mean I was talking about this. They have we have the most unconnected ruling class since before democracy which is pretty impressive when you consider that this is supposed to be the like the the archetypal democratic state or at least we like to think it is. They're absolutely unaware. It's pretty horrifying so I don't know what's going to happen like. I said my assumption is at some point reality will sink in and they will decide to put more money out there. But they're going to make it as as punitive and as humiliating and as difficult to collect as possible that will definitely happen. There's no question about that.

Somebody wants me to talk about quantum mechanics and I really don't know anything about it. I don't know anything about hard sciences so I don't want to turn into joe rogan It's fight to say that. I don't know. It's. It's yeah. I want to steer clear that thank you for the question but I don't want to more than anything. I don't want to just lose myself in trying to like guess around things that I frankly don't have enough of a grounding in. I'm not a math guy or or a science guy. I'm not bill m bill nye the science guy. I do I do. I do sense though like my my like more instinctive than an informed sense is that there's a lot of going on down there. If you know what I mean h in that quantum realm where more most interestingly the idea that causation breaks down at a quantum level. It's really interesting and I think it has some very significant implications that once again. I don't want to get into right now because I'm trying to not alienate people or myself by Somebody recommended william vollman's book about the nez persport yesterday and the only moment I've ever really tried to read is. I tried to actually read in high school. I think his gigantic book about like the ethics of violence. I think it only got halfway through rising up rising down all right.

This guy has got me tempted with the quantum saying. I don't I really didn't want to say anything. I'm just putting this out there as a theory. I don't want anyone thinking that I'm saying that I that that. I think this is true because I don't have enough of a basing in the science to suspect that to to have any idea But I kind of think that like the way to resolve the free will determinism question is that a freely made choice essentially ports you through the quantum space from one planet to another one version of earth to another where you make the choice that you make I am not on weed right now actually. That's one of the reasons. I'm being more hesitant is because I i when I'm not when I'm not chiefing that lounge it. It gives me more more residence to go off. I feel more confident to just kind of pull things out of my ass.

I did watch the last season of rick and morty. It was fine rick and morty is is now just a comforting a comforting fun program for all the watch. I feel like the the fever has broken around rick and morty the cultural fever and now you can just watch it and have fun have I ever read. Two books at once. Do you mean simultaneously no that seems like it'd be very complicated. But I have read multiple books like switching off between one and the other one spanish civil war. I should I have teased the spanish civil war neighborhood had passed before and now I kind of want to do it just to get everybody mad at me.

I would kind of want to like sketch it out in such a way to make sure maximum anger from both the anarchists and and the The the soviet apologists out there because there's plenty there's plenty in that material to to troll both sides pretty hardcore somebody yesterday. This reminds me something yesterday was talking about zapata. The mexican revolution and people in the comments were praising zapata like how he was you know the true revolutionary heart of the french of the mexican revolution. I think that's certainly true but I've always wondered with zapata though if zapata had been in a country that had a soviet-style revolution in it. He would have wouldn't he have ended up being like a like a a green insurgent like a peasant rebel against the modernizing urban communist party that would be trying to take power why wouldn't he be more likely to be a nestor monko type person and if that's the case who as a you know as a historical arper v vicariously getting your enjoyment from the heroics of previous generations of revolutionaries who do you pick so. Many people are talking about pol. Pot. I mean. I think I i don't understand why isn't pol pot canceled if not for the killing fields for taking cia support.

After the vietnamese kicked him out of power best snl. Deep cut that's a good question talking to adam. Mckay definitely brought back a lot of them and man. I mean I kissed his ass on that show for that but I it's unapologetic because having as I have a historic knowledge of snl. His his sketches his like five to one sketches to my mind are still the best ones they're like if I'm listing my favorite snl. Sketches. Almost all of them are going to be mckay's high c and turkey and orange julius of course but old glory robot insurance for god's sake I don't know how deep of a cut it is but I think mr belvedere fan club might be my favorite snl sketch of all time to tear the flesh to wear the flesh to be born into new worlds where his flesh becomes my key. That's good stuff. I watched the zoom snl's and they are by far the worst thing the show's ever done because it's not the show. It's not saturday night live the fact like the fact that saturday night live the premise of which was a live broadcast before a studio audience on a saturday night tried to do shows where they recorded.

In people's apartments really does show the maddening psychotic compulsion towards normalizing everything that undergirds the social order and what makes it so hard for us to confront real crises because we normalize crises instantly and that's what I've said that's what I said yesterday. I'm scared about global warming man because this is just a preview of how you know if like in florida sinks. People are going to be like you know it was florida. What did you expect not for it to be covered in water come on okay. I mean as soon as you're doing a show saturday night live and it's keenan thompson in his kitchen talking into a camera for 15 minutes. You've lost the plot. Like obviously they had the show must go on and mindset but that's not the show. The show can't go on and instead of acknowledging that things are such that the sh that the normal order cannot obtain we're gonna take some mutant. Distorted homuncular version of it and say no this is it and then you're gonna go yeah. I guess this is it and then now you've you've accommodated another level of of unacceptable horror in your life. I know that's not a very dramatic example but I think that it is indicative of a greater cultural phenomenon yeah.

I'm talking into a camera but I'm not saturday night live. I'm really bummed that hi-c in turkey is not on apparently. It's not on internet anywhere. I looked for it. I couldn't find it orange julius. I think you can find. I think it's on like dailymotion or something. But I see a turkey for my to my knowledge is not available to watch anywhere which is insane.

It's such a good sketch if anyone's ever seen it. It's about danny. Aiello plays a door-to-door salesman who comes into a family's house and he keeps insisting that they give him high c in turkey and then he's incredibly confrontational with the family and then it ends with him taking them hostage and demanding high sea and turkey from the police. Classic stuff one of my favorite snl quotes ever is daniel hello saying to the to the parents of a child your. Kid has goat eyes and he stinks snl. Mostly only puts recent sketches on youtube and I think that's because at some level they understand that if you put them next to even sketches from the mid 90s you would notice the decline in quality and I know that that seems like oh yeah grumpy stuff and I am generally resistant to that idea that like saturday night live oh. This is terrible. It's always bad relative to the time like it's never great. It's not like being a fan of another of a regular television show or movie or anything. It's it's being a fan of it's like being a fan of a baseball team.

You know they're gonna. They're not gonna be good all the time. In fact they're usually gonna lose. I mean yeah. I guess. I should say it's like being a fan of like the mets. It's not just being a fan of any baseball team. It's being a fan of a chronic loser. But it's your team and there's you follow certain players and you root for them.

And they have a good game you're excited but I've noticed that like recent snl and I think this is part of the just the flattening of of of everything. They just every sketch is just a premise. It's like hey what if this happened and then it just does that thing over and over again and that's that's kind of boring. There should be some sort of you should I mean if you have a absurd premise. The comedy you ring out of it is by escalating the premise and introducing new levels to the premise that shift things and are surprising because comedy is the point you know surprise is the point of comedy whereas now snl sketches are almost entirely a setting of a wacky premise and then just doing it without any any complication and part of that you know it's they're grinding it out and they don't really have time to to to fine-tune things. But it means that it's pretty crummy and if you're putting it on there on youtube next to hi-c and turkey.

I think a lot of people would be like what am I watching this for what am. I watching this new. For and the other thing they do on snl. Which I think is really really insidious is that instead of having instead of having recurring characters which was that's classically snl's bread and butter they have recurring premises where the characters have no notable quirks that stand out. It's just it's the premise and then they do the premise again so instead of having one sketch where they beat the same horse for 20 for five minutes. It's two or three sketches beating the exact same horse without even having like a charismatic wacky point character a recurring character to put any kind of like emotional arc behind or or character development because like I remember watching snl when they were when like there was there was a pat sketch every week but at least every pat sketch. It was like pat on a desert island pat with a robot you know whatever it was. It had some sort of elaboration on the on the premise even if it repeated the jokes whereas now it's just the premise being repeated so if they if they don't get back on stage. I think they should just stop the whole thing and they can just chalk it down as another thing killed by kovid oh boy gilly. Oh you're giving me flashbacks that was terrible man kristen wiig was pretty talented but she had no good recurring characters. Every one of her recurring character was insanely irritating. I don't watch them all so many people ask me like how do you watch every snl. I don't watch them live every every time. But they're on like they're. They're. They're like on the next day on hulu or something oh man ge. Smith was the king of the guitar face that dude constantly was just steven seagal style face just riffing off he loved it. He was also a big right winger and he played the rnc last year last in 2016. I think like ge smith's band played the rnc when they did benghazi night oh god.

I'm not talking anymore about a honk pill. I'm not talking about honk pill. I will say this last night. I was explaining the honk bill to someone and they were having a very fun time because they had no idea what it was. They were just dying laughing at the prospect of this thing and I actually read the the honk pill thread and reading it out loud. You really get how you get what the internet does to people's brains because no matter how eye-rolling or absurd most things you see on. The internet are in that context they're sort of given a. I don't know like a a surface plausibility or something because they're embedded. It's embedded but if you read it out loud to someone else as though you're just like saying something to someone. You you you can really just be like oh oh dear. This internet is just like this. This website is just churning people into into paranoid maniacs and and they're walking around with the stuff of their head. Thinking it's real and you're like oh my god. That's yikes. It's a yikes fan.

That's what it is. I kind of want to find it and read it again read it on here kind of because it reading it out. Loud was so funny. I'm just going to read two tweets that she did and like there doesn't even need to be a pipeline travel from chapo to true and onto red scare to stupid paul to fash. At that point. The dirtbags are welcoming in cells into their fan bases. Now those guys don't need terragram to lead them to violence and that 8chan terragram clown world and honk pill. Nihilism is already deeply laundered into the dirt bag left the honkler. His catchphrase honk honk is explicitly code for hh short for heil hitler is all over jerkbag twitter. You would not believe the number of dirtbag leftists using clown world and other variants of this meme. Like clown emojis in my mentions don't most don't even realize how the clown emoji got popularized as code for the explicitly nazi honkler clown world meme. It's beyond irresponsible. The podcasters are seating the left ironically with terror-friendly discourse and institutions like dem. Socialists and jacket and mag are enabling them because they care more about recruitment than they do about consequences. I don't believe they're deliberately trying to get people killed with this. I don't think the irony dead honkler creator chanters were either. I just think they're all recklessly indifferent to the potentially deadly consequences of their actions. I mean once you find yourself earnestly writing something like the 8chan terragram clown world and honk pill nihilus and not only are you talking about these things like they have meaning you're talking about them explicitly like they are life and death concerns like the hunklers if they're gonna listen to the podcast and then they're gonna kill everybody the honkler terragram clown world punk pill people. It really only hit me when I read it out loud how it's saying that stuff wasn't that kind of scared me a little bit because I'm like I knew it was funny and I thought it was like silly like oh.

Gwen's had it again but then reading it out loud to someone who wasn't online as much and hadn't read that stuff really hit me. Like oh. This is an entire like like self-created universe that somebody has fashioned out of the brickletage of the internet and turned into a turned into like a a existential battle between good and evil damn man. If that doesn't tell you people you need to like step back from the internet. I don't know what the hell it would just that is the abyss staring right back and the thing is is that like if it's all a scam to get people to like pay attention to her that implies that she thinks that kind of stuff is gonna resonate with people that someone's gonna read that be like clown world ponchler yes -h teragram yes and if that's the case then yikes if there are people for whom that is meaningful words. It's like. We are in pontypool. We're in the ponte pool universe where words have turned into a virus and are just burrowing into our heads and dissolving our cognitive function and replacing it with with a paranoid alternative fantasy realm.

I bet the nfl will def. I think the nfl will return because they've got the like the most united owners. They've got the most cow labor labor or most cow players. Union of any of the major sports and football is sort of the most like ritualistically encoded sport. We've got in terms of like validating america's hegemony and power and all that and the idea of like not having football is a fundamental undermining of of the american project and I don't think that they would allow it to happen. It's because the people who need football. The people who want football back at all levels. Including the ownership are the people least likely to accept that anything has really changed so. I would if they're if if football doesn't happen then then that means that covert really has gone out of control when am I going to push back on my celebrity guests probably not why would I i invite somebody on your show. I don't know i. I'm not a fan of that. I don't.

I don't see the point of it. I mean. I don't want to. I don't want to like counter sign something. I think is like wildly wrong but at the same time I'm not going to like try to like body check somebody who I otherwise respect because they're older and like they they their political imagination is different than mine. It seems like that just seems churlish. I think it's just that instinct of wanting to own everybody that people get from online and it's you know. I get it for being the show cause like we own people. But we generally don't own our guests. Like they're on the show you know we're trying to make it a vibe. The show's trying to be a vibe so people who want like and the funny thing is the few times we've ever had conflict with a guest people freak out. I remember when I remember when we had david cross on and he got into like a five minute argument with felix about louis farrakhan and back. When the subreddit still existed. They there was a gigantic freak out. It's like so we didn't have fun like. I certainly didn't enjoy that argument when it happened and it didn't seem like people enjoyed it listening to it. They all like breathing into paper bags like that's the example of that happening and it wasn't fun for listeners or us. So why would we want to do that somebody keeps asking if I've read rush. Limbaugh's books why in the world would I read the rush limbaugh's books yes. I read rush revere and the tiny patriots or whatever the weird children's book he did actually. We did edit that yeah the actual argument between felix and david cross was a little longer.

We cut it down a bit. Oh. There's a big long one. How do. I read all this and not go insane. It's tough. That's why I like to generally come with something prepared so. I don't have to look at the chat so much. But that's why I i. I said this earlier but we're hoping in the near future in august probably to to set up a thing in our studio with the gaming console and with chris there and like do a like a q a thing so that I don't have to talk and look at the chat at the same time and I think that'll be good. 

I gotta say that amon somebody asked about the amon bundy thing. I mean kudos to him for at least maintaining any some kind of just maintaining some sort of coherent world view which is more than can you saved for most of his conservative counterparts well actually no. I shouldn't say that they they have a conservative worldview that could they have a coherent worldview too. It's just that there are There are parts of it that they don't acknowledge like they think they don't like authoritarianism. But they just don't like the idea of having it used on them. They in fact depend on the idea they depend on authoritarianism and in fact fetishize authoritarianism against who the the people that they consider the enemy. The schmidty and other and give bundy credit for at least not subscribing to that.

I'd love to go on stop show that sounds great. I don't have a plan to but I would I've been. I went on a hassan show. I went on a song with with brace and liz yeah sorry about this. I usually don't do it this way but I just I'm out of ideas right now. I'm feeling like. I spent a spent for us. But I just wanted to say hi for a bit ever read robert anton wilson of course luminous trilogy baby. That's a college classic. I highly doubt it holds up but I really enjoyed it at the time. I own a copy. I haven't cracked it in a decade and like I carried around moving around. But I i guess I just like having it around but yeah no that was a another formative book. I've heard that there's a subreddit for the streams and that's very flattering and I'm glad that people are getting stuff out of them. So I i I i will admit that I have gone. I've heard people pointed it to me and so I looked at it kind of just to be like oh god. You know is this more of the same chapo trap house reddit stuff and I have to say that I mean it's not a lot of people and it's not like terribly active like chappa was but it definitely seems to be a better vibe over there. How do I stop it from becoming. Nihilistic people would talk I mean thanks to the honkler. Thing people have been talking about how nihilistic the grill pill is lately and as I said that's not a thing there's no such thing as nihilism even if you say it. I'm going to pursue my own pleasure. That's not nihilism.

That's capitalism. That's what we're all doing like you can call it nihilistic in like a long term because it leads to social and ecological collapse and is predicated on horrific exploitation. But you sure as hell can't say that it's not some sort of a value system. It is. It's just you've enthroned hedonism. You've enthroned and I think the way to push back on that and the way that it has to be pushed back on is to point out that our desires are not our own. The the idea that anyone can operate that any the people who are that if you're operating from like what you see as your your self-interest the way that like libertarians talk about it that that is somehow intrinsic to you that that's something that is generated by your like spirit and that's not entirely socially constructed is is a fantasy that undergirds a lot of the most pernicious and and harmful social dynamics we have so. I would say anybody's like yeah. It. I'm a nihilist like no you're not you're you're letting you're letting. You're either letting. You know the the the branded like lake capitalist machinery. Tell you what you want or even or if you're self-consciously like if you're being self-consciously trad or something in opposition to that you're still letting it control. You you're still you're still operating in a reactionary framework to a hegemonic culture of personal pleasure. What needs to be done is is.

I think what people need to do more than anything is interrogate. Their desires interrogate what it is. They think they want why they want it and I think a lot you'll find that a lot of the stuff that that feels like it's. It's at the center of your being is really compensatory. It's it's compensating. It's cope as kids say today and that you know real. Real. Value comes from from a rewarding social engagement and I think that's where I think that's what the grill pill which by this point. I'm already sick of and I wish. I hadn't even coined the term like everything on the internet. It just gets turned into a stupid phrase and and a collection of of symbols and to be like either embraced or denied or and then turned into a whole weird thing um that is like eventually loses all control that loses all relationship to whatever it was originally trying to talk about It's just like the logging off is the first step of a process that hopefully reintegrates you into a social value system that replaces that libidinal personal indulgence urge that that frees you or or leads you in a to a process that could lead you to be freed or at least significantly enchained unencumbered by a by that nihilistic self-centeredness because the only way that you can really like defeat ego orientation and and self-indulgence as as your driver is by having something else that has value to it and that comes from sort of offloading your ego onto the people around you offloading that sense of value away from your illusory sense of personal identity towards a larger and larger social organ that you are that you are part of and that your actions support you know creates reinforcing cycles of of ritualized and and and unstructured social life that provide meaning intrinsically like the the meaning arrives. Arises from the interaction. I have not watched the new perry mason show because the idea of a dark perry mason reboot is the kind of thing that bums me out about television and makes me not want to ever watch another show. I know people have said it's good but I don't think it's going to happen how many how many shows are there and one of them. How many shows are gonna be especially on like one of the few few formats that has any kind of remaining patina of prestige around it.

Hbo how many there's only a few on air at a given time and one of them's got to be dark. Perry. Mason was less have anybody even thought of perry. Mason. I know it's good. I know it's good. Somebody pointed this out to me the other day and it's 100 true that I still think and it's because. I'm a you know a It's because I'm an oregon trail kid. You know hbo was a big deal when it came out or after it came out and for a long time you know like that whole thing if it's not tv that was some real. Because you could see nudity and there were swears and it was mind-blowing if you could ever get access to hbo like a neighbor's house or something or a friend's house. You really felt like oh my god. I'm really I'm really experiencing something and one of the big reasons is was this. I bet most of you will have no idea what this is and will not recognize the sound. But this was this was the thing that this is the sound. This was the thing they played before every movie on hbo for the the big night movie and it was this there's a camera going through a model of a city and then sweeping over a suburban neighborhood and then through a small town and then mountains there. It is that's what you get when you log on to netflix comparatively you go you gotta let that's what you get that's it go on netflix.

That's it shameful where's the pageantry. I guess. That's what I want. I want pageantry damn it because and I don't think that that's just being a grumpy old man. I think there's something to that there's something just slowing things down you know maybe you wait for something. It's just. It makes you have to think about what it is. You're what it is you're looking for and and then it makes when you finally get it. It makes it feel more meaningful but yes. I know. I know 90 of the. I say on here is just okay boomer but I get it. I'm fine. I'm a boomer whatever yeah. I know I'm grandpa simpson. That's fine world needs. Grandpa simpson to tell you stories about the old days. I think we did steal cable at one point if I remember correctly. I remember some shady. Happening with with like a big black box yeah.

We had cable at one point but I think we also stole it at one point too. It was really easy back. Then someone wants to have an explanation for the tsarnaev fbi thing that felix mentioned so joe carr had his death. Sentence overturned on appeal today and felix pointed out that we'll probably never find out the truth about the boston bombing which most likely at some point involved the fact that that tamerlane the older brother who died during the shootout got run over by his brother was in all likelihood. Some sort of cia asset either a informant or or someone who was like being being run in some way or another by the agency and the evidence for that is obviously circumstantial but significant. One of the main pieces of evidence is that a year before the boston bombing three people were found dead including dzhokhar's best friend in a gym where he had worked out covered in like drugs the local police.

Their investigation was almost immediately counter taken over by the fbi who according to their own statements never interviewed tamerlane. Even though he was the best friend of one of the victims and no one was ever charged for a triple murder that the fbi was supposed to investigate for a year and then of course. There's the fact that after there's a bunch of weird with tamerlane and the the timeline. There's the fact that he went to dagestan went to the caucuses and met with like jihad leaders and the fsb actually informed the us government and said hey this guy's been in areas with terrorist activity meeting with people that are suspicious and it was never followed upon. Officially.

Also you have the fact that the that the fbi does not even claim that the tsarnaev's made the bombs. They stipulate that someone else made the bombs but they have never said who it is and there's never been anyone charged with having built a bombs and then there's the fact that a tamerlane associate a tsarnaev associate was being interrogated by the fbi in florida and out of nowhere grabbed a broom or something according to the agent who then shot him in the back and then that guy's wife was immediately um deported very very very eye-raising. And of course you know that's there's the alex jones thing and a lot of people who think that that means that the boston bombing was a false flag I'm always very skeptical of the whole false flag thing just because I don't think it's necessary.

But the fbi does one thing we know the fbi does is set up people for fake entrapment terror attacks so that they can pad their stats basically every domestic terrorism plot that's been thwarted by the fbi. Since 9 11 has been a case of pretty blatant entrapment. There's almost no instances of the fbi. Like the way you would imagine in a movie finding out about some cell and then catching them before they can like bomb a buy a bomb or something it's almost always some sleaze bag. The fbi pays going to find unstable people and say hey wouldn't it be cool to do terrorism until they say yes and then they bust them the most infamous examples of some miami haitians who got entrapped into trying to buy like a missile to blow up the sears tower and all of it was orchestrated by an fbi informant. None of it would have come any wouldn't. It wouldn't have ever come to anything because it wasn't anything without the fbi explicitly building it up and that's true of almost every every terror prosecution since 9 11 which means it's pretty easy to imagine tamerlane. Being one of those guys they got on the line and then at some point he got off the line and then they had to cover that up.

I don't think I don't know that's what happened but that to me seems like it's the most likely scenario. Sure patriots day the absolute propaganda what is the point of the stat padding. It's so that the fbi can appear to be doing something like I mean we've reoriented our entire domestic security around stopping terrorism after 9 11. And there was no terrorism to stop and if there's no terrorism to stop then why are we doing what we're doing. But if there's a plot if there's some guy who's going to blow up the sears tower and there's some guys who are going to attack fort dix or something. Then there's a reason that we have to be fighting this war. So one thing you have to remem realize is that the fbi before 9 11. They did a lot of stuff. They had a wide remit to to investigate federal crimes of all types financial political corruption and after 9 11 it essentially all went to terrorism. What's the message if they don't find any what's the message yeah we put our. We put our our our our most. We put our our biggest the most effective federal police investigative agency on the case of terrorism and that's like yeah. No there's no real nobody's doing anything what the are we doing in iraq. What are we doing in afghanistan. Why are we droning people come on.

I'm going to wrap it up here. But I want to say. I just want re-watched. I watched it when I was. I watched it in the theater. This when it came out as a kid ninth gate with johnny depp roman polanski movie I remember hating it as a kid because it was boring watching it again It's still pretty slow. I'm not really a fan of polanski's later work. I watched ghost writer 2 and I didn't really enjoy that either but it's definitely funnier than I remember and what really struck me more than anything is that it came out the same year as eyes wide shut and it's sort of about the same thing. It's about the idea of the rich as a satanic occult force that seeks dominion through ritualized sadism and and and like debauchery but whereas kubrick is looking at that through like a a sterile but still deeply judgmental and scouring eye polanski's kind of like lol. This is hilarious and it's probably because like kubrick knew about all the horrible. Rich people did from afar but being you know a a spectrum germophobe weirdo goldbug. He probably didn't do anything about it whereas polanski as we know is is one of the evil demon rich people. He's one of the epstein level perverts and so even though they came out the same year and I can't imagine like I kind of imagined like he heard about it. I don't know because eyes might shut was being made for like five years. Right took him forever to make it and I just imagined polanski being like oh stanley. What are you.

What are you doing. It's great come on some rare books. Some tokens we'll do some horrible sexual assaults it'll be fun. Deadwood was the best hbo show someone wants a word on deadwood best hbo show there's yeah. There's a lot of fun little deadpan bits in the ninth gate the ninth gate. There's one scene when johnny depp is pouring over this satanic tome to find the these engravings made by satan and he's there he's in the office of this This rich french scholar woman in a wheelchair whose book he's borrowing and he gets knocked out and he wakes up. She's strangled in her wheelchair and it's like on and he turns it around and she just shoots out of the room through the doors and the doors fly open and the other room is on fire and it's a very good very funny deadpan moment. I gave it like an extra half star for that. It's certainly no eyes wide shut and it's certainly creepier than that because you know who made it you know. It's actually. It's like sort of the It's the It's the cabal. It's like the cabal being self-aware and just like yeah. This is what we do. It's kind of fun.

Oh you really this is freaking you out. Is it okay square someone's asking jonestown be included in the mk ultra category. I I remember growing up the big book of conspiracies that was my intro to parapolitics as a teenager and that's where I first encountered the theory of james jonestown as an mkl giant mk ultra experiment um. I don't know if there's a terribly large preponderance of evidence on that um so. I'm not that's another one. I'm kind of agnostic on like. I don't know if there's anything comparable in the in the jonestown. In the jonestown chronology to you know manson spending an entire summer at an mk ultra essentially living a block away from an mk ultra. A funded experimental outpost in san francisco the bay.

I mean the the weird eye thing about jonestown related to politics is how deeply connected jones was to the to the san francisco democratic party and its mission in the moscone machine um. But to me. There seems to be a relatively banal explanation to that which was that jim jones was capable of on a moment's notice getting hundreds of people to volunteer for any campaign that he decided he would to support. He was an instant campaign staff and like canvassing teams for any any issue or any candidate who wanted him and that kind of manpower is very very hard to come by especially in local politics and so he he leveraged it They made they put him. They made him like they put him on that the the I think like the civil rights enforcement council in in san francisco and in the housing authority like the planning committee or the housing committee and then as they were getting ready to go to. Guyana is when feinstein really tried to like get hooked up with him to try to try to get some help from him for her for her campaign. Then he split off to guyana thoughts on transhumanism. I always assume that all that all the all the singularity transhumanists ai stuff.

All I put that all in one basket and it just seems to me to be a big old. Pile of cope just seems like people wanting a way out. That does just it feels like technological. It's like a techno mileridism. You know. It's like. It's like a it's techno millenary. Apocalyptic fantasy a way out yeah techno techno religion and and what is most pernicious about. It is it's generated by an inability to reconcile with finitude with the idea that your life ends. The idea that you are part of something and that your specific part of it has to have a fixed beginning and end as all things must and that only only the the monstrous only the monstrous inequality that this system creates could give anybody for a minute. The fantasy that they could conquer that and I think the ninth gate is actually It's got a funny scene with that with the with where frank langella thinks that he has basically become like satan's like vice president or something and he gets to live forever as in like as like a lord of hell and to prove it. He dumps gasoline all over himself and then starts burning and he's all happy for a second because he can't feel it and then all of a sudden. He's like oh no oh transhumanist diluted wild wackos. Even if any of this stuff was real if it wasn't just fantasy in my opinion. It's like the mercury tonics that that ancient chinese emperor used who thought he was gonna be a mortal drank 

It's the same thing. It's. It's. I have. I have attained a separation from all humans. I have. I have worshipped my own ego and my own consciousness as the end all be all of the universe I i am I am. I have assimilated full solipsism with the help of the financial and economic resources that I find at my disposal and I'm going to use those resources to further a a fantasy or a quasi-religious fantasy of eternal life rather than acknowledged about the limits. The inherent limits of any ego based orientation.

All right guys. I'm sorry. This one wasn't too good. I don't feel like. I was terribly good. I'll get some stuff for next one. I'll take a couple days off. I think but good to talk see you guys soon you.
