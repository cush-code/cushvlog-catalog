Oh stop sign speed limit nobody gonna knock me down. Hey. Mama look at me. I'm on my way to the promised land. I'm on a hell way to hell on a highway to hell bow on a highway to hell on a highway to hell. And I'm going down all where is my money. I dm'd one of the people who's still active who I bet two years ago. Q anon would not result in the arrest and prosecution of any top level pedophiles. He's still online. He's retweeting. He hasn't tweeted for days or weeks. He's just retweeting other people give me my money he bet me a grand. It's over trump left not with a bang but a whimper and it does look just from a cursory glance that the q people aren't are actually absorbing that it's over and that the whole thing was a lie which wow I don't know how the hell you pick up the pieces after that. I honestly think there's a good chance that a lot of these people will just become apolitical because if the one hope that you've ever seen to change things turned out to be a con artist and the one thing that ever made sense to you turned out to be a big lie.

How are you supposed to move forward with any confidence. Some people are gonna recommit of course but I think a good chunk are gonna are gonna become quiet to some sort or another which is good. Take it take a minute take a breath. I mean when you swing in a miss that bad you can't just get back in the box. You got to limber up a little bit. You're clearly something is off in your swing mechanics if you are going after this. There is the I mean it's a it's funny how little we've mentioned. We've emphasized this but seeing donald trump seeing the person of donald trump and thinking that guy cares about me and wants me to be better. He cares about america and wants america to be better that is the greatest piece of like self-deception. I can imagine that you willingly stabbing yourself in the brain with a those people irrelevant where's the violence where is the insurrection where what happened what was where why the stuff.

I'm supposed to care about. I was supposed to spend the last two weeks since the sixth gnashing my teeth and all those other people who did that were in the same spot now and who had a better time who had a better time in the intervening two weeks. Honestly. They probably had a pretty good time too because the key thing to understand about these people is that they like it. So it really just boils down not even to whether or not you're enjoying yourself. It's what gets you off and worrying about that kind of thing does not get me off worrying and fretting and making sure that I'm presenting enough concern is not anything that gets me off. But for these freaks. They love it poor at poor dan besner and amber co-host amber.

 did a totally reasonable cogent well-written piece about humanon for jacqueline and these because it did not do enough to condemn them as if what's written in the pages of jacobin is going to determine the contours of the q on movement in the next years absurd. But I will say the funniest thing about it is. People insist that you can't talk about q in in the context of causes. You can't talk of the immiseration or more specifically the destabilization of formerly secure economic positions that makes people more vulnerable to this stuff. You can't talk about that because that lets them off the hook for their racism and their hatred and their evil which is exactly what conservatives said about terrorism when you would say hey how about we make it so that fewer people in the middle east want to kill us by. I don't know scaling back our imperial designs on the region. No that is giving virtue to these people.

This is not focusing on their wrong and sinfulness. It's the exact same approach which makes sense because they're trying to create a um a internal white terror. 911 context for them to to stave off critique of biden and justify expanded um. Expanded internal surveillance and repression. I don't think it's gonna work and I said this on the show but the big reason that we're on terror went the way it did is because the republicans had a willing partner in the democrats like they were both on the same they were in wrestling parlance. After 9 11 the democrats were happy to play along and to be the heel to be the to be the to admit their weakness basically to admit what was that they were wrong to admit that the republican view of the war on terror the republican view of foreign policy. The republican view on what it meant was the correct one and that the only difference between the parties is that the democrats do a better job of it. The democrats are going to try it but here you've got an opponent who will no sell you the republicans as we saw in the impeachment hearing none of them what they got 10 votes. They were not falling all over each other to say look we understand.

This was a huge deal. We're so sorry. We have to look into ourselves nope they said actually you guys said that riots were good last summer. So you're hypocrites. You and without a huge. It's like like when what's like roddy piper would do a a a chop like slap the chops of hulk hogan and he would just start going and he would no sell it. That's the republicans here so that means that the dynamic is not going to persist and they're not going to be able to wave the bloody shirt. The way they want to but man the media and their handmaidens are going to try as hard as they can to do it holy. It's going to be non-stop banging this drop but I think I think that that was the high water mark maybe wrong and if I'm wrong I'll apologize. But even with only a few weeks retrospect it looks like that capitol hill thing was a was the high water. It was the picket's charge. It was the it was the culmination of a movement and then when trump disavowed. It immediately got kicked off social media and then slunk away with his tail between his legs and then biden got in there with no problem I think that it's that the momentum will be dissipated that doesn't mean that violence will go away like I've said stochastic violence. Stochastic political violence is here to stay I think but the idea that there's a genuine trump threat to our horrifyingly banali evil mechanisms of democratic government. Is is gonna become more absurd as time goes on. Although man I 100 percent get how if you are just like a regular person who doesn't have like a political critique of the system as such but is aware somehow that the system is bad watching the media. I understand how it could turn you into a trumper. I could understand how it could make you ins start thinking well.

[09:19](https://youtu.be/P9xGxsN6JZc?t=09m19s)

These guys are all in charge. You got the guys in charge and then you've got the media all saying the exact same thing. I mean the people the the press the media. During this inaugural was north korean in its supplicancy. The george they might as well have. Had people come out you know in a giant um a coordinated dance move and like spell out corn pop on the national mall. They they talked about how biden is a good and just and and kind-hearted man who's going to bring who's going to bring back unity and respect and all of every good thing.

He is a harbinger for its return and when things are just as bad as they were before he became president and the media is still talking like that on behalf of one party. How do you not think that the whole thing is rigged and that therefore the only person who is on who is not on the side of this evil status quo is trump because he's the only one who has been pronounced. Anathema trump is anathema. None of the the republican party is gonna be brought back into the fold mitch. Mcconnell and roy blunt were out there yucking it up with everybody and the irony and the fire funny thing about this. It's really ingenious how this works so. I really do think that everybody in the media everybody who's on there for all those networks talking about how biden is light itself and he's going to bring back civilization and he's going to banish the demons and how our long national nightmare is over They think they're helping. They think that the trump movement and and the capital storming is sign of a fundamental undermining of necessary crucial american institutions of government and media and that by going all in for biden they're helping they're like They're. It's sealab. 2021. I'm happy. I'm having you but they're just pouring. Hosannas for this guy when you have to know it's not.

It's things are still gonna suck and it's all just that you're feeling better because that um because the images are more pleasing to you than the images of the trump years. But the fundamentals will be the same by doing that you are ensuring that anybody who is just watching this and is not invested in the symbology that you are is going to take away from it that you're all in this on you're all in on this together and the trump is the only one who stands against you. Although maybe not trump honestly trump might have. All over everybody didn't he he just went out there and said have a nice life goodbye oh and I'm gonna just I am going to pardon. All of the most corrupt political scumbags on earth literally swamp denizens and no no assange no snowden no manning no reality winner. Nobody who is threatened nobody who threatened the the state apparatus celebrities and fellow celebrities and fellow politicians people who he could identify with personally because that's all he ever could do because he's a. But the challenge of there being any coherent post-trumpism is how do you fill the void of trump and I don't think you do.

I think it's going to be a splintering. I think you're going to see a a wilderness period here. But what's going to keep the republicans in play and likely get them back the house even with their being a pretty much open civil war now within the party. I mean liz cheney has already had some local yahoo. Announced that there's challenging her for the house next year anybody who spoke against trump in the last two weeks will get a high profile primary challenger how that boils down though. I don't know I'm not doing predictions but man it was really nauseating watching the news.

Just people can people manufacturing a reality right in front of you but you're watching something that by any objective standard is a hair-raising nightmare. Just think about this stripped of the ornament on the national mall surrounded by 25 000 national guardsmen and 12-foot tall steel barriers. They led this speech off of a teleprompter and in well. Everyone's wearing masks and there's no actual crowd because of a rampaging pandemic. That's killing thousands of people a day that's the reality of that inauguration. But what we were told. We were seeing is some triumph of american democracy and the return of of values insanity and and and compassionate leadership and everyone doing that thought they were thinks that they're shoring things up. But what they're really doing is undermining it even faster by ensuring anybody watching that yes this is exactly as rigged as it looks like this is exactly as anti-democratic as it appears to be well who's up for some the last section of the republic for which it stands h . Let's finish this bucker up so r.i.p.

To the gilded age you were a real one so let's go through this chapter by chapter. The first chapter is about urban poverty and immigration. We get all the good jacob reese stuff about the tenements and the the horrible conditions within and the reform movements that attempted to ameliorate those conditions. All of the all of them headed by people who thought that the immigrants who lived in those conditions were barely human anyway which obviously complicated the process of trying to do the amelioration and he talks about the assimilation of those immigrants into the american experience and this is where he really emphasizes that like the people who made american culture what it is like actually gave it culture were the immigrants. The middle class protestants who were who were trying to turn their lives into everyone's life. That was where culture went to die and the degree to which that model prevailed in the 20th century is the degree to which american culture failed to exist because that protestant home that they were fixating on this middle. Class home is is the place where the middle class expectations for values morality constrain behavior and thought to such a degree that meaningful artistic expression is almost impossible like yeah where what what american culture is is black. It's jewish. It's catholic and and poor poor protestant poor white protestant middle and upper class white protestantism created basically no culture very little and he finally talked about baseball and how it became a a and how it was. In fact a immigrant sport. It was played mostly by german and irish immigrants. The next chapter we got lizzie borden and which is although he said he claims white claims that she is guilty um the baseball statistics dork I keep. I want to say rick james what the his name last name is. I know this guy is bill. James bill james in his book about american crime claims that she was innocent but anyway He uses her as a good example of how white womanhood which was this thing that these systems were designed to protect. Was being undermined from within and the anxieties that that created in the people who saw everything going wrong.

People saw that all the things that that the contract labor the contract freedom individuated citizenry individuated liberty notions that they had built was creating the opposite of what they wanted and they were freaking out about it. But the main thing I wanted to talk about here. Is the populists because in this section we talk about the rise of the populace in the west and the midwest and I think of the populist movement as the last gasp of the of the smallhold. Yeoman um conception of american liberty politically expressed before it was subsumed in the 20th century by broader ideas of like the working class. Because at this point working class political organization is still incredibly in kohei. You had things like the knights of labor and you had things like the the afl. But there was very little political expression. There was no amer there was no labor party nationwide labor party of size. There were a few 

There were things like the greenback party of the 1870s that that were attracted working working-class votes. We saw how henry george attracted working-class votes when he ran for mayor of new york but there was no single labor party workers if they were catholic mostly voted for the democrats if they were part of the urban machine if they were protestant in the north anyway. They probably voted for republicans because those sectional distinctions mattered more than ideology and it is and white points out that one of the things that has american working class political effect efficacy is that partisan formations emerged before the working class became articulated as a self-conscious notion in most in the european countries that got pushed the ball of socialism. Further mass universal manhood suffrage came at the exact same moment that the working class was coming into being here. The the the party system that they were dealing with emerged in the 1820s.

 when the model of employment was if there was employment was artisan based mostly where wage labor was relatively rare and usually a condition a transitory condition of life and so when these western and midwestern farmers who had followed the railroads out west as the they've been told to by the republican forbearers vote yourself a farm party and told you can find freedom with land property will be your liberty. You don't have to worry about politics just vote for the republicans. We'll keep a nice lid on inflation with the gold standard and will allow you to bring your crops to market but with the infrastructure that we've invested those tariff monies into and allow you to live freely well. By the 1880s many of them were finding out oh the system of crop lean financing and the manipulation of freight rates by railroads and the deflationary nature of gold standard is actually making that making it hard for me to be free even though I have land and the populist party was an attempt to articulate that politically to articulate a a producerist idea of american freedom and after the defeat of william tyx bryan in 1896 and the subs and the transfer of like the reformist drive into the two political parties from outside of them where the progressive movement did most of the The work that they demanded but not through the expression of a like a coherent political party like the populists that dissipated and was replaced by what we got by the end of the but certainly by the end of world war one a political concept that was consumerist in its conception where people's freedom was not a freedom to make it was a freedom to buy and that changed fundamentally the nature of political contests in this country and ensured for one thing that the working class when they did become a more coherent and effective political force would be amenable to exchanging the demand for control over the conditions of labor for more purchasing power and that is what we ended up getting. In the 20th century.

We got a working class that over and over again in its political expression traded autonomy and power for consumption and that turning point for that. I think really was when the populace were broken and one of the reasons they were broken is that they were unable to link up effectively with the working class as white shows the brian. Brian's democrats actually saw their share of the urban working class vote go down even though the urban working class the catholic ones anyway were by and large democrats because this was a rural protestant dry movement evangelical in nature and that and was not like culturally amenable and because the democratic party sorry keep honking.

I'm consuming are people saying there's a problem with the oh boy. It's choppy oh no oh man that poem was dog. Poem was terrible just awful all right well. Let's just move through this. Then quickly. I'll I'll probably not go too long um okay.

[26:42](https://youtu.be/P9xGxsN6JZc?t=26m42s)

We've got the the depression of the panic of 1893. Another another another railroad panic. This time caught started in argentina but once again causing a significant collapse in credit and liquidity and there was nothing the government could do about it because it was committed at the top of both parties to the gold standard. The gold standard was invaluable even though the base of both parties was probably broadly in favor of at least bimetallism. If not full fiat currency. The upper echelons were completely controlled by gold bugs and that speaks to the the way that the democratic impulse in the in the american political system is will always be dissipated and diverted away from the like load-bearing structures of whatever those in power at the moment. Think constitutes the the governing status quo like it turns out that you can actually do a lot with fiat currency and you and you can still have capitalism and you can still have banks and you can still have credit and you can still hold your citizens enthrall to the moneyed interests even with fiat currency.

But nobody knew that back then and more importantly the people demanding currency devaluation and and more currency in the markets were almost universally people hostile to existing power structures so just by that virtue alone it was not going to happen and while you might have the votes at the grassroots to push for expanding the currency at every level higher as you get towards the senate and the presidency you're getting to points where electoralism is diffused more and more away from a um. I hate to use the word but accountability and that accountability is replaced by systemic incentives and that's why you had. In the middle of this depression. You couldn't get one of. The two political parties to come forward and say hey what do we do something about this until william jennings. Bryan shows up at the convention in 1996 and gives the cross of gold speech which cuts through all of the malarkey. Cuts through the bossaries cuts through the existing structures and allows the this demand to come forth.

But it is rather than the beginning of something. It really is the last gasp of this producerist sort of jeffersonian jacksonian model when it comes back again after world war ii. In the form of you know the small government conservativism that and libertarianism. That is now you know the dominant ideology on the right. It is in the it's not. It is been fully subsumed by consumption and I do think it's interesting that one of the last things that he talks about is the role of the courts in establishing corporate personhood and a substantive due process system that made it very difficult for workers to strike but made it very easy for corporations to do almost anything they wanted and that is another example of the constitutional system doing what it was designed to do which is to dissipate points of responsibility away from democratic accountability because the judicial branch is of obviously the least democratically the the branch of government least sensitive to democratic pressure and the people appointed to judge ships are most likely to be amenable to people at the very top of the party structures that might be in power which means they will reflect those interests and the period of the late 1890s or the late 19th century that that brought about the progressive movement.

It was a creation of it was a self-realization on the point of this middle strata of political class judicial and legal media and corporate managerial that the competition that had been the the bulwark of the early capitalist system in america was counterproductive and disruptive and needed to be reduced. And that's when you saw the rise of the the trusts and that's also when you saw the assertion by the judicial branch of the prerogative to define the constitution to essentially make effective working class. Political organization almost impossible and it's only when you have those things in place that the progressive movement which comes after this can take hold but that's for the next book in this six. In this series I know is that one in there let me they have. I don't think they have one for the whole thing yet in the oxford structure but it looks like there's no oxford history for the years from 96 to 29. So there's like a 30-year gap so someone's got to write that that'll be interesting oh. It's called reawakened nation.

I'll probably read that so the next book we're not gonna start right away. I'm gonna think about it. I'm thinking it might be fauner's reconstruction or maybe dubois. Black reconstruction not sure yet. I'll take recommendations if anyone has them if anyone likes wants to dm me or something. I have read late victorian holocausts. That's a great book. Mike davis is absolute king.

[34:31](https://youtu.be/P9xGxsN6JZc?t=34m31s)

There's no question about it am. I still like skipping or is it good. I don't have just so you guys know. I have no way of changing any of this. I like people say switch to a different numbers and p's or whatever. I don't know what any of that means. I'm good now okay good. It's skipping oh.

And then you see 500 people getting a line to tell you how it's the most inspiring thing. They've ever seen. What are you supposed to think about that how are you supposed to think like am I wrong. They assume that you will just go with what they want you to say. But like the whole point of media. Fragmentation is that people can go to what is amenable to them. People can find the voice that is agreeable to what they think already and what we're getting from the state media. About this inauguration is. I can't imagine agreeable to anybody but fellow bubble members. Other democrat not even democratic voters but democratic self-identified voters people who identify emotionally with the democratic party the way that republicans identify emotionally with not republican party but trump and that means you see that and all of your efforts to try to you know. Reinstill these values about the sacredness of these american institutions is just going to further drive people away and it's more than anything. It's just humorous because you know they're so excited. They're so excited to be able to do this to be able to go on tv and assert that that we are in the best of all possible worlds now. But what that means is they're going to keep being surprised as things. They don't want to happen happen as and as people keep acting away that they don't want to act what was the poem about. I have no idea. I mean. I know it's mean to make fun of like she's a kid. She's like 22 years old. But you know there is still something off-putting about being expected by a unbroken chain of people to be enthralled by it. I will be checking out the new adam curtis documentary that's for sure and one last thing. I want to say about that biden speech which was just an absolute snoozefest. He annoyingly he didn't have too many fuck-ups. They really know how to keep him gassed up during the big speeches but the thing itself was incredibly boring and it's and soporific which of course is the idea you're supposed to soothe everybody back to sleep 

[37:53](https://youtu.be/P9xGxsN6JZc?t=37m53s)

But there is the part where he quoted augustine and said something about you know. A community is defined by the common object of its love and the sec. And what he said was some about like the common la our common love is. I don't even know. I don't remember it all sifted through my brains. But whatever pablum it was whatever abstract principle. It was it was incorrect. The actual common object of our love is free refills that more than anything is what has spurred. A lot of the political violence of the last year is being kept away from our free refills and the soda machine is running out the syrup is almost gone. The bubbles are dissipating and all they have in. In all they have to replace them are words and the words are supposed to do the job and they think that should work because it works on so many people but more and more. It's working on people who are the least affected who have the most soda who have access to the most refills all right.

I think I'm gonna probably stop soon but to back to the q anon one more time and the comparison between the way we the the rhetoric of the war on terror and the rhetoric now one of the things that seems to make people really mad when you try to really talk about the rep. The trump phenomenon as a social phenomenon is that if you do not emphasize at every moment racism and and authoritarianism and fascism that you are letting them off the hook that if you talk about a material conditions creating the ground on on which these things emerge that you are undermining you know the the the rhetorical case against these people which needs to be made yes that is mirror to the way that the wright talks about terrorism. But what I think is really interesting also is that when people say that when they say oh economics economics these people are just racist well sure and they're delusional and you're not going to get them and their argument you shouldn't court them. You shouldn't think about what they want because they're raving maniacs and they don't even know what they want.

That's true. But when you talk about addressing any kind of pathological social condition terrorism cue whatever by addressing the material conditions that spawn it it's not really about doing anything about the people you have who are currently part of that movement. It's about stopping the flow of people to it. It's stopping people who otherwise would not do that do it and there seems to be this idea that the q thing is like a dormant dna strand like just pings after a certain moment and then people will just flood its ranks and if that's true if there's something just in the dna of like lump and white culture that drives them towards conspiracy and white nationalism. The activator is precarity and so the way to deal with an immersion phenomenon like that is to reduce the amount of precarity that is felt by these people who might be triggered that way but people resist that because if you could ever become that in their mind that means that you are irredeemable and you don't deserve better material conditions. The very thought that you could be tempted into cuteness means that you don't deserve them and that is the liberal logic that underlines the whole project.

The the whole liberal left social project because we can't make things better for anybody. We're going to punish the deserving and the emergence of this mega movement and q is a chance to beat the snakes out of the grass and punish them which is exactly what the bush administration tried to do with terrorism. Huey long every man a king when no one wears a crown. I think I've talked a bit about humiliating in the past. Hugh long is what you is is is the southern expression It's not a coincidence that the huey brown came from the deep south because the deep south was. The least was the area where where like working-class politics was least able to find purchase and was replaced instead with real demagoguery. The kind of stuff that you know the the brahmins are always afraid of but at every point though that demagoguery is abetted by the very ruling class who claim to be afraid of it In this section of the book they talk about how the the adherence to white supremacy and specifically the democratic party as bulwark of white supremacy meant that the populist party could not make inroads among the agrarian workers of the south of the small like sharecroppers and stuff who were or the white ones anyway. The ones who could vote and were also exploited by the crop lean system and railroads and everything and that's why the populists had to nominate brian in 96 because the southern populists are I mean sorry. The the they knew that they would lose in the south that they would not be able to compete that they would end up giving the presidency to 

The republican which of course is always the problem that third parties have to deal with and one way you deal with. It is by not caring and there were populists who didn't care. In fact. It was mostly the southern populists who didn't care because the real southern populists had been fighting for years against the right-wing bourbon. Democrat aristocracy hated them because they were happy to use intimidation and violence and fraud to keep them out of power just as they had the republicans before them. But it was that partisan adherence of southern democrats of southern small farmers that ensured that the populace could not form a unified producers front how is the australian ballot causing voter suppression. The australian ballot is the secret ballot. It is the written secret ballot in the north. A lot of recent immigrants didn't write or speak english. They were able to vote because tammany for example in new york would give them a ballot that was filled out already and say go and vote and they would having had to have people go into the room and write the ballot. Themselves meant that people who couldn't read english were unable to knowledgeably exercise the franchise who is the second funniest president okay. That's a good question somebody asked first of all somebody asked was anti-immigration.

The left position I honestly think in the 19th century if you're talking about popular politics left and right are kind of inapplicable. They're a little. They're a historical you had populism and then you had like the establishment and populism was anti-immigrant because immigration was a complete cop because immigrants competed with native labor and that has always been an issue that sort of and but it is also self-defeating because immigrants are still going to come and if they are denigrated and and ostracized by the populist forces the same way that black free labor was in the south. You create divisions within the labor pool that can be exploited by the ruling class at every point so it is self-defeating in the long run but it is also if not moral. I guess inevitable would be the word when you have a situation like in the late 19th century of a stagnant of declining wages declining standard of living and increased immigration But the kind of but and it was not universal like the knights of labor were anti-chinese but they made significant real attempts to try to woo southern black workers because they could they could identify southern blacks as american and and amenable to like the american producers ethos that they were trying to protect in a way that they could not imagine. The chinese were and those kind of stuff. Those kind of distinctions can only be broken down by by the sort of cosmopolitanization that comes with capitalism but anyway the second funniest president hmm okay.

[49:47](https://youtu.be/P9xGxsN6JZc?t=49m47s)

I guess george w bush was kind of funny although looking back on it. The stuff that was funny about bush just seems so banal now it's kind of amazing. I think biden honestly might end up being in the running depending on how senile he is or at least how senile they allow him to be seen as but we don't know yet in terms of ones who haven't yet in terms of ones from the past. George h.w. Bush was kind of funny just because what a dork he was I mean he puked on the japanese prime. Minister talked about how he didn't like broccoli. He had dan quayle as his vice president another guy where you look back. It's like oh that's adorable that people were amused by that but no like if he if he was if you could have seen him every day and if you could have heard him every day andrew.

Johnson would have been the answer because andrew johnson is the president who's most like trump in person and not coincidentally andrew. Johnson is the last president to not um appear at the inauguration of his successor because he was like trump an incredibly bitter little who was all consumingly narcissistic and viewed the entire pageantry of like the american political um. The entire the entirety of american politics through a personal lens through his own validation of himself like Johnson claimed that he was doing what he did imposing an incredibly lenient reconstruction on the south to protect the small poor whites of the south who he thought because he'd been a unionist before the war and opposed to the slave power because he thought that slavery hurt poor white people. The most and of course slavery did hurt poor white people. The lack of the concentration of wealth in the hands of the planter elite meant that the south was wildly underdeveloped. Compared to the north. It had almost no public schools of any kind and very little infrastructure. That poor people could have access to because why what what's that do for me as as a as a grand d of the to facilitate the flow. The capital flows that they were interested in in facilitating so it did hurt them but to johnson.

That was the only hurt that mattered because it was his hurt because he had a trumpian nixonian resentment of people who were higher up in social the social order than he was and so even though he was pursuing what he thought was justice for the small poor white of the south. The system that ended up coming out coming about at least in part as a result of his actions and re-enthroning the planter class after the war was one where poor whites were by the end of the century in the thrall of a democratic party that was ruled by bourbon aristocrats who had no interest in seeing those poor whites advance and who maintained the disinvestment in public infrastructure. The reconstruction governments that came in after johnson left office the ones that were often headed by carpetbaggers or in some cases. Freed slaves were the only governments during that whole period that actually invested in public infrastructure in public schools for whites and blacks and you had a figure like tom watson who emerges to be a populist to and at first tries to create a coalition between poor whites and blacks in the face of the persistent. Racial hierarchy ends up saying well if you can't beat them join them and becoming a fervent racist and democrat which might have helped him sell magazines but didn't help the poor white people of the south.

At all do. I think trump or his family will suffer any legal action. I don't want to predict much anymore muggs game. I would be very surprised. I'll say that if any of these people go to jail or are even charged with anything. I'll be very surprised because presidential impunity is baked into the cake. We're looking forward not backward remember. Lbj was pretty funny that's a good choice called his dick jumbo that audio of him talking about his His bung hole to the guy from hagar slacks that's just funny. There was also a when I went to the lbj library. They have a replica of the oval office and they have a phone you pick up the phone and they'll just play random parts of the lbj. Presidential tapes and I i put it up and one of them was him talking to catherine graham the publisher of the the washington post who I believe he had an affair with and he is just coming on to her.

Like a maniac he I believe. At one point he says bob was a steer and you were in a if. I was a steer and I saw you in the paddock over I'd jump over three fences to get to you and of course. He talked to his aides while which is just alpha king posture and he also said I had more talking about lbj or talking about jfk who of course has a reputation as this lotharios lothario he said. I had more women on accident than that boy had on purpose. He was basically buck strickland yeah and I absolutely believe that he had a bigger dick than jfk just for the simple fact. That jfk was irish james. Buchanan was apparently a very erratic and touchy like a prickly guy like an unpleasant person and kind of like a fussy sort of school army. Type. Guy and yes was the first well. He was the gay president that we can say pretty definitively exist. I mean there might have been other gay ones but buchanan was definitely gay which that's tough for the gays because he is definitely a johnson but definitely one of the worst ones. His predecessor franklin pierce was just a hardcore alcoholic which says a lot because it was hard to become an alcoholic in the 19th century because everyone was shit-faced all the time anyway. Garfield was a nerd garfield was one of our most 

He's like he was an a real book bookworm real real nerdlinger and he loved lasagna all right. I'm gonna maybe go in a minute. Here see if there's maybe one more question before I say goodbye frederick. The great was so gay that he wouldn't look at women like you actually wouldn't like set eyes on them but he didn't. He also after his boyfriend got his head cut off in front of him. By his dad he he focused on war.

The brits are freaking out about biden in what sense because he's going to reunite the 32 counties. I don't think he's gonna reunite them. I think they're doing that themselves with the bloody brexit in there. Irish she's barely irish. It's like half irish at most yeah apparently now for the first time in american history. We've got irish a catholic president catholic speaker of the house and catholic supreme court chief justice which would have made thomas nast's the bishops coming out of the ocean. Like alligators they did it. They conquered people who in the 19th century those bleached out. Brahmins thought were incapable of republican governments are now our. Governance are now at the top of all of our institutions really does show that that the stuff that people fixate on is rarely the that matters. But that's exactly why they fixate on it because it allows an illusion of progress. An illusion of issue addressment addressment an illusion of progress towards policy towards a better republic towards the shining city on the hill when in reality you're just you're just treading water while the machinery continues to grind behind the wheel. Alright folks peace out.
