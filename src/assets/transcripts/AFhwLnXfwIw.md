Maybe up there this hi guys get going blood a sadder. I think I might go outside actually. It was raining earlier but it's been very nice recently and I think it might be more it might be nice enough to go out. I don't know I'd have to zip up the old T s. That's right tracksuit. Baby good evening to everyone including those of you who are cursed to game through life. Let's take a walk. Let's see what's going on oh yeah. That's nice. It's very nice out. This is nice. I'm sorry about the twitch ads but gotta gotta support the brand always with the stripes three stripes going back to the shack jacking it up in the old shack back can I get an Opie.

I don't know what that means. It's had some sort of a gamer reference. I don't feel like I can in good conscience make any gamer references sorry. I am NOT a pong well I guess. I am I guess. I'm a dog. Oh. I know what people mean when they say oh yeah.

I say hope I guess but it's hard to remember I don't want to fight. My neighbor come on guys sold out oh man what's going on guys. I don't know what happened today did anything happen. I don't think things nothing happens. Right anymore is that the rule that we've all established that nothing really happens to the degree that it ever did. Nothing is ever happening as a discrete incident. Everything is just happening simultaneously. It's not just like a big. It's like a big cubic zirconia that you just look through.

I don't want to play stardew valley because that seems like it's just farmville and I never really liked farmville when it was on Facebook. When I had Facebook yeah. I don't know when we're gonna have the gaming mechanism up to Epping running yet. But when we do I'll certainly figure something out play some games. It's gonna be hard to do those strategy games because I'm just not very good at them. I don't understand how the mechanisms work. It's very confusing to me and something happened with Elon Musk like he's going to jail because he won't stop his factory from manufacturing cars that explode and kill people is that the idea it was that he won't stop killing people at his killing people.

Machine factory is that it soo I told you guys. He is the Epstein for billionaires. He's not a real billionaire. He just is a plays a role and it's as a propaganda mechanism to make you faked it like there's anything innovative or useful about the billionaire. Class shouldn't he take the time that they're making him close the factory to make the cars not explode and kill people. I mean wouldn't that be a good thing to do with your time if you were ill on. Musk then try to keep the place open and kill your workers. Yeah. I don't know it's gonna go out with that guy. If he goes to jail. It becomes like a civil rights martyr. That'd be very funny and very fitting honestly. Let's put him on the money who cares cuz.

I know he's not American what difference does it make he speaks. He speaks epic that's the only language we care about in 1640 in Britain which faction of the English Civil War do you joined. I mean you kind of got to pick the parliamentarians right you know like as gross as they were it as a bunch of stick-in-the-muds. They were of course you know what they did to Ireland and everything but I don't know can you really stick with the landed aristocracy. I mean you're literally defending them like last privileges of feudalism. I don't know but maybe if they'd won that would have like accelerated England into I it could have accelerated England into a revolutionary situation remember because like one of the big Mis one of the big weird things about Europe is that the most advanced English. The most advanced capitalist country never even had anything close to a revolution. Didn't even have any big demonstrations even during the the height of them in 1848 and people wonder you know what's the deal there and it's because they had a very very early like proto a revolution that was essentially a proto bourgeois revolution. It was like the towns versus the countryside even before those you know divisions had really been deepened by capitalism developing and so it really was like it put them on a footing to absorb the change in the economy. More more stable lis than countries that suppressed that sort of emergent energy like France so yeah maybe if the maybe if King maybe of King Charles wins then they have like an English revolution that really does something other than have a weird. You know ten-year interregnum where the guy's the king but not technically and also there's no Christmas. But that's the thing is like if I was there. I wouldn't have those thoughts you know I wouldn't understand what was happening. I would largely my views would be largely dependent on where I stood in terms of like where did I grow up. You know I was I was I Anglian you know townsmen was. I was I like a fail son of a baron somewhere was I in Ireland that would determine where I would who I would fight for. The Scots are those the kind of cheeky guys because they get to act like they're victims of British imperialism. Even though they were essentially like like co-executor's of imperialism. They they like got. They got bought out early you know later on. They were doing the the hostile takeovers but the Act of Union was was. It was just a good old-fashioned buyout. It was a you know they got stock and and seats on the board and it was totally amicable and then they got. They got stock and so they were as much responsible as anybody else. But now they get to act like you know they were there there was victimized as the Irish or god forbid.

You know India or something ravenous the movie where Robert Carlyle plays like a Wendigo infused cannibal. That's one of those movies that's got a great look and a good cast but just doesn't really do enough with it which way does the Upper Midwest go. In the great American crack-up I mean they were smart. They would try to get out and get annexed by Canada. You know that would be like just immediately. Join Canada join the Commonwealth yeah. Then you don't have to like establish independent of political authority. You could just immediately be brought under the you know the under the crown and the Canadians would of course. I don't think that they would say no to that as much as they might think we're a bunch of oaths and we are but we're very similar to them and that creates a buffer zone with just rich in timber access to ports and deep waters. On the on the other side of the Great Lakes. Much better access to the Mississippi River ya know the smart move. There is to join Canada. Presumably Canada is still around and I think it would be come on. It's Canada.

They're not going anywhere. Now Ohio is the surbhi of the Midwest. Wisconsin is Croatia. Michigan is Bosnia. Illinois is Slovenia and Minnesota is Montenegro and Indiana is North Macedonia. Missouri is Albania. Kosovo is like I don't know like Northern Kentucky or like like Pittsburgh. Some of that's not tech I don't know yeah. Now. I think Minnesota might be Slovenia. I was trying to to own them by saying that they were Macedonia the Upper Peninsula you know what Wisconsin should reclaim it anyway no matter what happens just bulldoze that line like Isis did to the sykes-picot barrier between Syria and Iraq. Get it back get 27 counties in Wisconsin plus 15 counties and Upper Peninsula equals what Pennsylvania is Turkey who is the marshal Tito of the Midwest.

I think it's gonna be Felix. I don't think we've had one yet. I think it's gonna be Felix. I think there's gonna be an additional when the breakout happens. There's additionally going to be a series of you know intense conflicts between the Midwestern states and I think Felix is going to knit them all together. In one is one nation one multi-national Midwestern Federation that will either be closely allied to to the point of self-defense treaty with Canada or maybe even annexed and he could be like a like if is a regional governor-general or something of the new territory. I don't know I think it's gonna be Felix I believe in him.

Someone wants to talk about the German peasants war. The German peasants war is very interesting because it's what happens when you start giving people ideas basically direct results of the massive cultural ferment caused by Martin Luther's Protestant movement. Although funnily enough when Luther found out about it he was vehemently opposed. He wrote a big denunciation of the peasants were you know for swearing their oaths and blaspheming. God by you know deciding that they didn't want to be slaves of some disgusting depraved margrave's and but they got put down real hard got down put down real hard. All those rebellious Lutheran princes didn't think twice about massacring their Massacre Andrew people there because but the thing is is that you know there was no putting the catch it back in the tube without like the least. The establishment of Protestantism is like one of those elements that's you know causal but at some point is caused by just the intense fragmentation. The the pull outward centrifugal force of authority in Europe especially as you know the post Black Death proto capitalist economy starts growing regional autonomy city-state autonomy. The universal Church was gonna be put in crisis there and then the social relationships that capitalism breeded were much harder for Catholicism to absorb into their social bloodstream Catholic Protestant countries took to it much faster. I think prince-bishops were appointed by the Pope.

I'm not sure I'm not sure whoo this is a good one. If you were making a worker's party in the US. What animal would it put its logo be that's a nice whimsical question we could have fun with instead of you know thinking about decay and collapse and all that so all right let's go first. We got the big ones right Republicans that's the elephant thank you Thomas Nast and the donkey is the Democrats. I believe that's from Jackson so what else what else could we have now. There's. The bull moose for the progressives isn't there like a new Whig party that has like a so if it's working honestly. The donkey is such a good one but sadly at this point has been too spoiled by its association with the monstrous Democrats. It should be an animal that represents some sort of strength collective ability and will determination. I don't know I'm kind of thinking bear finally enough. Think of the damn bear a Bisons not bad either. It's like halfway between an elephant and a donkey as opposed to like a totally different thing. But a buffalo is good because it's a you know. It's native bears too. Though beaver I don't know man. There's the whole double entendre.

You're gonna have to give people are gonna give you the big. The business about that is you're gonna have to be like no shut up ants. I don't think people want ant society and also ant society is kind of what we're trying to avoid here. Ant society is what Bezos is trying to impose on us when we're all in our little cubby holes getting our nutrient slurry and our Amazon our lootcrate deliveries to keep us from killing ourselves for another day. Bees are better but yeah that's - associated with Mormonism ork. There we go yeah that'll be the flag that flies over the Midwestern state house the Midwestern governor's the new Miss Webb Midwestern Governor General's mansion which as much as she Felix loved Chicago. It can't be there because it's already too powerful. It'll have to be somewhere. They would have to make pick up somewhere geographically in the smack dab middle of the Midwest which depending on how it shakes out could mean Oh God Indiana. Oh.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry Felix you're owned capybaras. Not bad. Everyone loves a good capybara but it is technically a rodent. I don't know if people really like that idea being associated with rodents. The Budweiser Clydesdales. That's from a commercial that wouldn't be good how about the Budweiser frogs. Those guys were cool. They drink tout when they drank beer. I mean who would you want to have a beer with more than the Budweiser frogs. You george w bush dilly dilly guys dilly dilly. See the nooks are one of their interesting questions if there's like a if there is a real centrifugal power struggle in America between regions the nooks and honestly.

That's the one thing that I think would prevent it from happening honestly more than anything would be an international and the the necessity at the international level to prevent our ridiculously massive nuclear arsenal from just spilling out of a orderly chain of command. But I don't know I don't know enough about how they're secured do. They even have missile silos anymore. Those all discus continued. I know they don't fly those old the the b-52s anymore. Like the NORAD thing I know we got a lot of them on the submarines which literally means that they could be it you know under control of that captain. Oh boy can you imagine if a iowa ohio-class sub full of King nukes.

Just decides that he's gonna you know commence the Great Awakening early if Biden becomes president. Why not let's put it on the table who knows let's play. Eschaton I can't wait for more Biden Holograms. I think more people need to talk about the reality of Holograms. Like is we don't know enough about the technological capability for computer-generated imagery to know if Biden's appearances lately are even real and I'm mostly joking but like is there any independent confirmation that he is conscious awake alive other than the something on a screen and I know that a certain you know level that's always the case in this in a spectacle society but come on man come on man. He hasn't been seen in public in weeks is he a hologram I would like to see proof and I don't know if it's possible to even provide provide it to the degree that I would believe it if he showed up on my front door. I probably think he was a very realistic looking animatronic because that's probably how he would act if it was really he did fall asleep while talking to Hillary.

But maybe that's the thing is that they've introduced the new Biden 2.0 but they can't have him all of a sudden be super on the ball super sharp. Because people would notice that too he needs to start off sort of at a level base line of incoherence and then slowly they make him sound more legible. He's sharper and before a few weeks go by you don't even remember that he was all out to lunch you're like damn. Pie didn't is sharp. You see breakdancing is he doing this shoot dance is he flossing. My god is he Devin and he's doing all those things on top of a casket carried by the gun and dancing funeral men. In an epic mean. I gotta say guys as much as it would be funny for them to try to put Hillary in there. I think I think they're gonna try to go with Cuomo. He's in the same orbit and I think everyone must realize I don't know maybe they don't maybe. They don't realize that Hillary can't win maybe. They don't realize that she is She's damaged goods cuz. Like at this point. I can't like it occurs to me how up a lot of you know your ability to just game anything out at the political level is anymore because when you're trying to evaluate rational actors right in a in a political context you know international relations. Whatever you assume a baseline of rationality and competence that I don't know if we can at any level so who the knows because it's like well. They wouldn't do that because they because of X but they might not know about X they might not have heard it or they might not believe it. They might think it's fake news but I would say that the reason because the thing is they could replace Biden.

After the convention. I'm fairly positive of it because I was reminded of 1972. If any of you guys know 1972 when McArthur I'm sorry when George McGovern got the nomination it was against the party. It was very much a Bernie Sanders style insurgency. He was not liked by any of the main party powers especially George Meany to see the chairman of the afl-cio and the most important person single party single. Most important person in the Democratic establishment outside of the you know outside of government and so they tried to him. At the convention.

They tried to sneak Hubert Humphrey who didn't even run in any of the primaries through the or or oh. I'm sorry who started halfway through and ran late tried to sneak Humphrey through the prime through the backdoor and they had to scramble to get the nomination and they were so focused on it that they never even really thought about who should be VP until right before they were supposed to go and accept the nomination and so they had to spend hours arguing about it because nobody wanted it because the whole thing looked like a dog and apparently at one point they wanted to give Ted White they wanted to give it to Teddy Kennedy. Teddy Kennedy said no then they wanted to give it to Ted White who is the mayor of Boston and Teddy. Kennedy said no I'll that guy I hate him and they ended up going with a guy who had been opposed significantly to McGovern in the primary in fact the guy who had coined the term acid anestine and abortion to describe the whole McGovern platform Terry Eagleton. But he was a Catholic from Missouri and he was gonna help with those white working-class voters. Like Biden is supposed to have and then during the campaign almost as soon as they start campaigning.

It comes out that he not only had been hospitalized for mental illness but he received electroshock treatment which in 1972 is viewed very very badly. That's viewed as that is someone who is unstable who can't be anywhere that anywhere near power and eventually after the McGovern campaign initially said they stood behind him and they work at it. They weren't going to give into the gutter politics they eventually asked him to step down. He resigned and that was between the primary and that was between the convention and the general and what happened was is that the DNC met and picked a replacement whip in consultation with McGovern and it was Sargent Shriver who was like a Kennedy cousin or something and head of the Peace Corps. If Biden said he dropped out because he was sick or something in in September. All the DNC has to do is meet and replace him so they have the incentive.

The thing I'm wondering though is because they have so terrified of opening the doorway to left-wing politics right especially with the scare that Bernie put at them that I kind of wonder if they genuinely don't want to win. Now. Obviously we talked about how the Democrats don't want to win in the broad sense if they don't want to be in charge long enough to have to him put in any you know to to propose anything that their donors aren't gonna like. But they still have short-term incentives to gain power just for the patronage involved. I mean there's a lot of people who want to work in the White House. There's a lot of people who want who are Lobby who want to be lobbyists who can connect the White House to industries. I mean there's a there those people in the DNC. They have a short-term personal interest in seeing a Democrat in the White House because they can make connections they can get jobs in the administration and more importantly.

They can get jobs after the administration as lobbyists for seven-figure salaries which is the whole point of the thing in the first place. It's to get to that point. It's to get to the seven-figure lobbying job where you just have lunch with four different. You know diffe guys from different awful industries and under secretaries of whatever and congressional staffers and you put it on a card and then that's your that's your date workweek and you make nine million dollars that's the whole point of the being a democratic establishment figurehead or like being anywhere in the in their hierarchy. So there's a reason they would want to win and with Trump presiding over the biggest you know economic crisis. Anyone's ever seen and in the middle of a a public health crisis that he demonstrably and obviously botched and it's like I mean obviously the 40 to 44 percent who loved Trump will never admit that he this up but I think to any degree that there are voters who aren't really ideologically committed to either party deeply like in a symbolic level of emotional investment. I think they're even gonna recognize that he this up I mean it's hard not to look at us and look at us compared to other countries and see that there was a real mistake. Here.

People tend to blame the president especially in election years for those kind of things. So they know that there's a chance so there's gonna be that short-term desire to get in there. Just a bit wet your beak you know just to make another notch on the agenda just to make more connections that can be used later for money but man given how bad this is gonna get I kind of wonder if they're worried that if they get in the pressure from their base to actually do something is gonna be so strong. They're not going to be able to pawn off enough of it on the obstreperous Republicans for not allowing us to get anything done and they maybe prefer the option of just letting trump and McConnell do everything and then just throwing their hands up because then that leaves them not vulnerable to you know pressure from the within their own base because you look at the way Pelosi has governed and I said this the other day she has just passed she has taken. She has assumed there's no reason to pass anything in the house or even put things up for votes because they won't pass the Senate so we'll just wait for the Senate release to give us things we will criticize them and say they're not good enough for whatever. But we'll still just vote on them and that shows that in a massive crisis like that their instincts are to defer to the Republicans because they're afraid to go out on their own. They're afraid to just start riffing because they don't know where you know. They don't know where the boundaries are. They would rather have the boundaries set for them by another party in power and with the other party in power. It takes a lot of the pressure off or below for their own constituents to do something so there could be. A real I mean but I think there are a lot of people within the party who say it. I want I want to win but I think that there's not sir there's certainly not a unified feeling among the Democrats. I would guess at the highest levels about winning this thing which is gonna throw a whole other x-factor into the whole process.

It's baffling somebody wants to know if there's gonna be another silver corp with dan Bilzerian. I certainly hope so but that guy is totally fake right like he didn't even he was he washed out or something of I mean I don't know I don't want to get. I don't want to get sanctioned. I don't want to be tactically kinetically you know interdicted with. But I thought that he was sort of one of those fake seals I want to know where his money comes from. I don't think it's his. I think it's his family's. But I wonder where it comes from I wonder also if he's related in any way to another Armenian gentleman with delusions of grandeur and mysteriously large sources of independent wealth chairman Bob Avakian I am not worried about being swatted on stream.

I'm not talking loud enough for the police to be called I hope not anyway and I think that I would be asked to be quiet before someone called the SWAT team unless unless there's just this growing hatred that's going to result in a swatting so I'm gonna ask about the Fermi paradox. I think that the answer to the Fermi paradox just comes down to I think there's a certain limit on our ability to access energy that makes the sort of distance traveling impossible. I think more likely is interdimensional travel just like interdimensional cable like if those aliens that people are showing on those newly declassified Navy videos and everything that I think there's a hat 50-50 chance that that is all a mark viral marketing scheme to get people excited for the next Angels and Airwaves album or their new angels and air fries series of home appliances. I'd say those are more likely interdimensional objects than from from that far away people keep telling me to read those three body problem books. I've got to do that I'm gonna pick those up. Soon. I promise how should I talk to my PhD Lib father-in-law that hates Burnie and loves markets. I don't know talk about the weather talk about like a movie that you guys watched. Maybe you don't talking about politics. It sounds stressful find something to talk about that's you can commiserate on and you gotta remember that in Phil's family debates there's a real you know. That's gonna prevent you from commiserating and really agreeing on politics and you know what Dad would ever want to admit that their kid knows more about politics ie life than they did.

I'm glad someone enjoyed Richard Jewell. I really liked that movie and I'm hoping to do an episode with will about it soon now that it's streaming made me think about late-period Eastwood. A lot differently. I mean I still hate American sniper but and I thought the mule was kind of goofy. But I think he's trying for something. He finally got it to work McConnell's idea to to allow states to go bankrupt.

I'm assuming is just a ploy to sort of set the bidding conditions for whatever bailout. The states are gonna get because that's not viable like just as a just as allowing this the government of the United States to be a a viable state. This the the United States themselves are gonna have to be made solvent to some degree. I mean that's literally what caused the Articles of Confederation to break down so it'll just have to be a RiRi foundation like a refoundation of the the balance sheets and the economies of the states and it end budgets. But what conditions are that going to be how is that gonna be carried out. I mean we're already seeing that they're moving the right wing. The guys that saved people in Hell want ice water to are already moving a little bit. But you see how little they're moving. They're moving in a way to establish that the conditions of eventual agreement are going to be on their terms. I mean you saw the leak today about how a AEI and the Hoover Institute are planning ways for people to get stimulus checks draw from their Social Security telling people that if they want to be able to pay their rent for the next month or have food in their house they have to guarantee that they won't be able to pay the rent or have food in their house when they're in their 70s that's psychotic vile. But they're setting the stage so that if it's somewhat less awful and dystopian than that then you feel relief and if it is that bad well we didn't don't say we didn't warn.

You. You know you could have stopped us but nobody did nobody stopped. Us we'd. Some. It's a free country right. It's got elections and yet we're still doing this. We're voting for this stuff and it's passing and you're baying it at some level. You agreed to this yeah. It's Rimmer. It's reverse mortgage for entitlements and it's a beautiful way to cut them really and though you you undermined them in the long term potentially dramatically and what in the shortness so the in the shorts and how do you pay for it by borrowing more at a time when it's basically free well. There's essentially no interest rate on American debt come on that's a small price to pay to destroy that looming Social Democratic skeleton hanging over everything Social Security or Medicare yeah. If someone points out. Yang is not gonna be able to complain about that because that motherfucker's whole idea involved taking from entitlements to pay for ubi benefits or preventing people who use a certain amount of disability or whatever from getting them. But you know the thing to remember is this is changing everything this is this is a heart. This is a level of hardship that we are not ready for that. We have never experienced that I don't know if we have the cultural. I honestly don't know if we have the cultural resiliency. I guess is the word I'm looking for I don't know if we have the cultural resiliency to handle the kind of stress that's coming yeah.

Pontypool I didn't really like that movie because it was like what I wanted a zombie movie where's the zombies this is. Like that just purely meaning strip noises that we just reflexively spew as soon as any challenge to the world as it exists is presented like hey maybe things could be less bad for everyone. I'm gonna pay for it. I'm gonna pay for it just like a honk just not even being produced by your conscious mind. Just barked up by the accumulated ideology just nesting in your brain matter. I have not considered doing an erotica calendar. I don't think that would be good for anyone. I don't think anyone would like that we're gonna have soupy. Soupy brains brains like soup delicious delicious chowder. I don't know about RBG if she's alive or not or Biden for that matter. If they've perfected hologram technology. They all might be gone hell.

Maybe they all got executed as part of the cue Adama Great Awakening. Maybe that's true I don't know it's crazy ah oh my god. It's wild what's going on. Ah I see. Here's the thing I don't think that Felix and I are in disagreement because I'm saying that in the near term he's right it probably will just be more of the same but but worse. But the thing is is that that will eventually the worse like the the worsening reaches a concentration level where you get an inflection point and you get a new level of worse and at some level that will be and eventually that new level of worse will be far enough away from where you were that you could look at it and say oh. This is a qualitatively different sort of social arrangement and a qualitatively more brutal exploitative and doomed one. I'm just saying that that is the trajectory even of the seemingly banal worse the same but worse same but worse but over time that worse cranks up and we don't know what the timescale is now because we have all of these variables that are completely unknowable.

Somebody wanted to know if Nixon voted for upton sinclair. I highly doubt it. He was a rock rib republican. His entire life actually interestingly enough Jerry Voorhis who was the congressman that Nixon defeated in his first race which catapulted him to Congress when he came back from the war with his navy suit talking to the committee of a hundred and getting them to give him a check. He got his start campaigning for epic being an epic organizer in campaigning and running for the state legislature. As an epic candidate. He lost that race but he ended up later on becoming a state Rep and then becoming a congressman and was a left-wing one of those like Maury maverick type. Pinko congressman and Nixon went in there and just read baited the hell out of them right at the perfect moment in history and beat him which is how he also then ascended to the Senate by by red-baiting Helen Gahagan Douglas very misogynistic aliy. He famously said that she was pink down to her underwear yeah. It was the only way he really know how to win. He couldn't really spend positive visions like Reagan. It was all just pit viper attack. I did not see Burnie today what was he being interviewed being ignored again. I probably just wanted to ask him about Biden boy.

It's sad but they must move on what's the sexiest Pokemon I gotta figure. It's one of the ones with female human features right like big lips big sexy lips or something. But I don't know what any of the Pokemon look like. I'm assuming none of them have like butts or cleavage or anything. So so. I'm just gonna assume something like that people saying jinx. I don't know what that looks like I'll take your word for it. I've never done pokemons. Somebody asks about inflection points in 20th century US history. That's a very good question. I think I think Reagan's election in 1917. 1980 is an important inflection point because yes Carter was the first neoliberal president but but Reagan's election which sort of took all of the same underpinnings that Carter had proposed that we're going to cause short-term and long-term economic pain in the middle of this country that was going to be lasts for generations. He was able to repackage with a new cultural form with the aid of the Democrats that made it much much harder to push against and maybe impossible.

We I mean the cultural detritus. The gunk built up around the idea of like the government that started with Reagan when the effects of you know the volcker shock with mass deindustrialization which with the with the undermining and fatal crippling of the labor movement. The effects of this are then felt as the results of government the results of some abstract notion of like government policy and then of course social permissiveness social liberalism and so you get this goofy mixed-up order where everything gets worse and people are less likely to blame the source of it so very bad yeah like that entire 70s period starting with the gas crisis which reset it reset everything in American politics because the the free real estate of the of the system at that point which had gone from the land of the 19th century. In the 20th century. It was fuel like the free real estate that allowed America to become a global Empire spanning country.

In the 19th century was the ability of any one basically to grab at very very low cost lands by rating them from the natives who had no power to resist after a while effective power to resist anyway and in the 20th century that turd did to the fact that we had basically free. Energy gasoline was was was a big business but it was also wildly inexpensive and when that variable changed it changed all the whole calculus and all of a sudden. There was less profit and the question became where are we gonna get the profit and the answer. Because there were no workers in the room was from labor as a share of profit and that's been the case ever since but with that being undertaken by Carter. So the first effects start kicking in then and then solidified by somebody from a different party who is then popular because of his ability to channel cultural resentments. I mean it fatally handicapped for a long time any kind of coherent left-wing opposition to the to the systemic failures of the system so that's a big one. It's like from 73 to 80. That's a big one that's like that's the dial snapping into place. I said the in I said the inflection point was the regen getting elected. I'm just saying is that the proximate like crisis causing moment that led to that directly was 73 was the oil crisis god. You guys are so snippy.

Somebody wants me to talk about enclosures that's like a big Marxist original sin moment of capitalism when they threw the commoners off the land of England which facilitated the creation of an industrial working class in urban areas who had only their labor to sell because they couldn't subsist on land anymore yeah. Like that's why America basically had to come into being because the social the social friction caused by those sort of decisions that allowed for the creation of industrial proletariat's. They necessitated some sort of address and they couldn't be addressed through the system because it needed it needed to amass as much capital as possible. I mean that was its directive so the fact that there was a whole continent for people to go to if they weren't satisfied with their spot in the new order allowed it to develop and intensify in a way that would have been inhibited by political friction if that hadn't happened so it's very hard to imagine like cap the Industrial Revolution capitalism intensifying the way it did. It absent the the inputs in terms of raw materials and also the pressure valve of the United States.

Everyone's yelling at me about the inflection point I sent Reagan versus Bush Reagan. Versus Carter I was just trying to contextualize it ah shucks just trying to do a little contextualization geez Jhansi fremont baby. The pathfinder do I moisturize my beard. I have beard balm but I almost never remember to use it. I actually somebody has suggested I talk about Robert Moses in an episode I really should just because that part that Neil popper ization we talked about that that lack of a social self in a social space is very much tied into the physical environment that people were born into specifically post-world. War two the car based urban environment basically and then the suburbs around them but the front. But that's tricky about that stuff is that of course it was directed from above. It was directed for the benefit of certain corporate powers but it was also driven by a genuine desire. You know people wanted cars. I mean of course a lot of that is manufactured but at a certain point you can't tell people that you know we might do a movie. This week this midweek I don't know Al Smith is a very interesting figure because he is a very he's a proto. He's a proto new dealer.

Like he did. He basically carried out a proton a deal as governor of New York and ran as a progressive candidate in 1928. First Catholic to run for president. He saw his campaign train actually passed a line of burning crosses put there by clans members in Long Island during the 1928 campaign and he was kind of a he was a mentor to both FDR and Robert Moses. But he turned on FDR very bitterly once FDR sort of stepped up and stole the presidency from him in his mind and he ended up becoming a vehement opponent of the New Deal and he was trotted out by Republican business groups. The kind of people that he'd fought when he was governor to to just tell people how awful the New Deal was and it was almost entirely because it's his personal sense of aggrievement just pure pettiness. The man was nothing if not a bitter petty little dude just pissed off the Lyra shman for the Lower East Side a Matt oh what if we fought what if what if Atlantis rose from the Pacific and it was rich with resources and it was uninhabited. What would we do oh my god aah.

I think that would have to be instant war right like at this point come on it would have to be instant war. I mean maybe it would be proxy. Maybe. We would will real it our way back from the nuclear exchange but there would have to be some sort of proxy conflict. For that. We're not good what we're gonna divide that thing up at the UN maybe. Not at this moment not with this leadership of world institutions. Nope I was on Atlantis was a city and a continent I don't know it's not real as the thing I hate to break it to you well. Okay somebody asks why is class consciousness emergent workers but not in the Guild's. The there was a sort of class consciousness in the guild system but it was purely contained within the different crafts. Like there was a general recognition that the crafts had a head like a position a interest against the apprentices but between each other it was all competitive. It was purely contained within the the craft guild itself Antarctica and also they were not really being exploited. I mean they were the ones they were the Masters so craft consciousness. There you go but yes like the the the urban crafters who came after the guilds broke up in the early month early modern and industrial era became like the forefront of opposition to the new capitalist system but mostly long the same way that the guilds used to fight on like trade trade routes.

If the USSR was still around we'd still be going to space that's for sure I mean that's the reason main reason we don't go to space. Anymore beyond anything else is that what's the point if we can't if doing anything really big. It takes too long and costs too much to be invested in because like what what you what president's gonna sign off on like oh you're gonna land on the moon when you know well five presidents from you. How much is it gonna cost forget that is that there's no pressure from outside to do it if anything there's pressure from off-site not to do it in the form of hey people do want to go to space. We can just let these rich psychos pay for it that we can just let these weird billionaires to fire their bottle rockets at each other into the Pacific Ocean man. If Elon Musk goes to jail that'd be so funny if he tries to flee to space that would be really funny. Do you think you could ever have had an experience that would make you conventionally religious like Abrahamic Lee. You mean I don't think so because I could not the feel like my understanding of the universe has not allow it to be like particularized in that way because I'm I think I'm just too aware of the cultural like matrix that created those interpretations of you know. Like the great you know the great eternal moment that we are all part of blah blah blah. You know it's all obviously filtered through different moments in time and I think those are just a little too bit too specific for me. I mean I could see myself like going to church for a moment of peace or something but I could not see myself really investing in a conventional religious belief.

Somebody I believe is blowing. A shofar people are people are getting jiggy with it and if it's that time of the year it's that time folks. So I'm gonna be wrapping it up shortly get a few more questions in here. Do. I think the US would be better off split into smaller countries. I mean it depends right. I mean I would say that if that were to happen most of those countries would probably be in worse shape than they are now some of them might be in better shape. It might make the rest of the world be in better shape or worse so how it shakes out. I believe that is a cowbell. We've got a cowbell and a shofar going on people are going nuts. They're loving it and they're practicing there. They're practicing their gratitude. That's what it is. We're all practicing our gratitude here people keep recommending gene. Wolfe's I should check him out. Yes. They're not stopping folks 7:30. Why do you got to be different Canada well you got to go on the half hour you weirdos.

Someone says it sounds like Death Grips I'll take your word for it. I don't know what that means who would win in a presidential battle royale. Easy Lincoln I was a catch wrestler at a time when that usually involved eyeballs getting gouged out of people's faces. Tall rangy dude come on every other president is a befuddled round man or a did geriatric or her got. Jack Kennedy racked with 500 different diseases and maladies kept alive nearly by a dr. Feelgood injecting him with cortisone and cortisol and vicodin every 20 minutes and he was a freaking vampire hunter. Let's not forget that Teddy Roosevelt that big phony that big fancy man give me a break now what would be funnier would be what about a fight between the living presidents okay. Now we're talking. This is what the last thing we'll talk about before I get done living presidents too. Bad George HW Bush is gone because that would have been funny watching him. Just get punted out of that wheelchair so who we got. We got ninety five year-old Jimmy Carter who you gotta believe is gonna get get rinsed pretty quickly Then he got Clinton who is looking like a cadaver ever since the Enna's bypass and went vegan. He's just very frail and you know that adrenochrome supplies are pretty low. These days george w bush.

She's older now but he's still rangy. He's still a jock. Kinda. You know runs around probably got good. Cardio definitely better cardio than trump and then of course the oh bundler who is still very fit and a relatively young man I mean I don't even think he's 60. He says like mid-50s so you got to figure the o bungler will win but the oh bundler is at the end of the day the o bungler so I see him. I see Clinton and Carter getting starts pretty quickly due to their frailness and then I see Trump sort of wandering around and I see Obama defeating Bush and hand-to-hand combat. Like the first blood. He's ever actually had on his hands and then Trump just like without even noticing bumps into a TV or something and smashes him in the head with it. It doesn't even know it and survives because Trump will live forever because God delights in human evil. All right guys talk to you tomorrow bye-bye.
