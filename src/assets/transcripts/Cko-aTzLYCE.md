Okay there it is who is there the great commotion motion motion. All the country's here's room ball. I'm rolling on for tippecanoe and tyler too and with him will be little vain. Van is a used up man and with him will beat the little fan. I on again. What did was I on and then dropped off or was I never on before this. I couldn't so was there like an interruption or did it just not go on until now. I don't understand how the all right well here's my voting ball. I got today when I went to vote when I went to my early voting place which lucky me was the barclay center and I was able to walk up today. I'd see lines in previous days but today no line strolled in got the deal it works. It took me five minutes and if you want to know who I'm voting for who I voted for. I'll just say that for a long time I resisted the demand of people that I put you know my country first and future generations of this planet and sacrifice. My lofty ideals in favor of the practical need to defeat rising fascism and i. I admit that I've resisted for a long time.

But I finally come around to the wisdom of it. I'm finally ready for her and so today I voted for hillary clinton and I believe that that her defeat has humbled her and I think now she's ready to come and and clean up washington. I think she needed a loss before she could really understand. You know what the stakes and and what she really wanted you know like she took it for. She took it for granted and now after having lost it. She'll never take it for granted again which is why I think she'll govern wisely and justly so and so if anyone yeah you can't get mad at me. I voted for hillary I actually wrote in everything because I did not have a very interesting contested ballot. There wasn't even anything at the local level that I could punitively influence the results of so. I went nuts. I think I voted for myself for congress. Real fun was in the judges. I had to vote for all the supreme court justices most of whom were running unopposed so. I got to write in some fun people. There like judge reinhold judge doom so as usual. I enjoyed the experience.

I enjoyed getting my ballot. I enjoyed filling in the little bubbles and most of all. I love sliding it into the machine and going a little boop and then get my little guy and hey I even got a stress ball. Here. It says don't stress vote early don't know why you would give that to somebody when they were already doing it. But I guess the idea is they bring it out there. Maybe it gets thrown in a little waste dump and someone picks it up and remembers to do so. So. The supreme court recently ruled that the that states will be able to suspend the the counting of mail-in ballots after the election because they will be by according to kavanaugh prima facie in illegitimate because they will flip the results of the of the race in that state. That is I think people. I mean people pointed this out insane what he is saying. There. There is no legal or constitutional basis for that states have five weeks to register or to certify their results. There's nothing in any law saying anything has to be announced.

The night of the election that's never been true. What he's talking about is tv the fact that we have the media to do projections and take early returns and exit polls and make like journalistic guesses that we because they're pretty. You know well hedged and they wait long enough take his gospel and then aren't confirmed later by the actual vote count. But if you're a cranky old man watching tv no you don't know who who won on the night and that's not a standard. It's insane to expect oh to say that legitimacy of the election matters because grumpy confused old senile fox news viewers like the president are too angry and and confu too confused by the prospect of them not announcing the the winner. On the on the night of like. There is no way that you can argue that that's the reasonable standard for undermining legitimacy of an election unless you think the entire country or those who count anyway are fox. Knewing fox news watching demented old people and of course. This tells us that if this does come down to a trump versus biden style court case that they will figure they will find a way no matter how ludicrous the base is to invalidate the votes necessary in the states necessary for trump to win. I don't think anyone will should have any illusions about that there will not be some moment when all those supreme court justices stand up and say no sir.

The the honor of our institution will not allow us to go along with this blatant theft. They've already laid the groundwork they're gonna. They already. They did the thing that even the guys who wrote bush versus gore said don't do which is sight bush wishes gore because it was just an extraordinary moment where their partisan leanings took over. They said look we don't even want to bother creating sustainable legal theory. Around this we just want the result and that'll be it again and the response. I think from liberals to this ruling has been very interesting and it's one of those things where you see in the small bore. How they might have a point in why they act like this. But then you see how their small bore thinking inevitably sabotages them in the long run. So the response has been okay now that we know that if anything is if if anything's in the mail on election day it's probably not going to get counted because that's now the precedent according to the supreme court which is legitimate um.

That means it's your responsibility to get those votes in early do it now and I understand the argument that well hey nothing's going to change. This you want to be able to you know adapt to the situation but what you're doing when you're doing. That is you're also setting up the situation perfectly. After the election is stolen where it's really all of our fault isn't it the same way it became nader. Voters fault that they stole the 2000 election. It'll be people's fault for not voting early enough. Even though now we knew you were supposed to the same way that the fact that presidents have been elected. The last president was elected with less with negative three million vote lead well. Hey you know that's these that's the the system and you need to plan for that. So hey they're not going to count your late votes so you need to plan for that. It means it'll always be our fault. It'll always be the fault of the electorate. It'll never be a systemic rejection of democratic input. But I mean these guys are freaking out about some sort of judicial coup. We already had one and they blamed the third party vote for it.

They blamed susan sarandon for it okay what more do you need well. Somebody says it's amazing how much faith libs put in a system that keeps them over the system rewards them. They do well under the system but doing well under the system offends the liberal sensibilities and bourgeois senses of manners and values that they've absorbed to be part of the people who are doing well by this current regime and so they need a political expression of that discomfort which is democratic politics. But it's not designed to do anything to the system itself because it's not hurting them. It's in fact the thing that sustains them. They merely want an expression of disappointment and a way to feel the discomfort but well with relieving a personal relationship to that discomfort. It's not because I am an extractor or I am in any way advantage by the system. It is that the the racism or like the constitution or or fox news has led weight around our nation and prevents us from from being fully democratic oh well. At least I'm aware of it and I'll vote accordingly to help other people and so when I say that they're setting themselves up for failure down. The road not for them continued success and and thriving within the system but for the people who take cues from them so the masses of regular voters who've internalized the logic of the liberal. Of the democratic party to the point of um psychic you know fusion.

Bernie should not join the cabinet. I'd say that for one thing bernie is not an administrator anyway. I mean at least with elizabeth warren. You have that pathetic thing about how she's missed plans and miss details and you know maybe that's right put her. You know. She probably does belong certainly not a politician. She should be some sort of regulator at best you know. It's just a cog in a machine designed to like look over balance sheets and find out when to you know there's too much fraternizing going on between corporate entities. Let her do that but bernie's not a administrator. I mean. I know he was mayor of burlington but 30 years ago. But I don't know if that's relevant really. Also he would then be part of a regime that is going to be hostile to the left on day one and so he will only serve as a mechanism to deflect anger towards what is going to be a wildly reactionary regime that is going to declare war on the working people of this labor department could do honestly whatever it is whatever flurry of regulations he imposes is going to be nothing compared to the larger battle over the future legitimacy of the democratic party because he's going to be part of that regime.

But that's I don't think it's going to end up mattering because I don't think he's going to get one man if chile does revive cyber sim. That'd be so funny. They're not gonna revive It'd be funny if they recreated cyber sin and then cyber sin brought ayande back to life. That'd be funny no probably not gonna happen what about bakarin somebody's talking about bucharan don't we love. Bakarin folks. I'm kind of I'm kind of thinking that bakarin might be a little underrated honestly like he probably had the right theoretical position vis-a-vis breast lotus and then collectivization. It's often described as like a whip side from the left to the right. But I mean it was a recognition of the of the of the fundamental weakness of the of the russia as a potential place for socialism to be born because of the fundamental weakness of capitalism which they all recognized as marxists is necessary for the building of socialism and basically just because they were in a position to win in a contest with the state because of the state's collapsing legitimacy and authority. They basically made a post-hoc rationalization around trotsky's permanent revolution idea to say will kickstart a revolution and that'll do it and that meant that when it got to the point of ending the war but current said we need we're going to need europe. For this. We're not going to do it so we have to turn this into a revolutionary war because I mean as soon as brussel tufts happened. Then what was this what did russia do sat and waited with baited breath for germany to have a revolution and they failed to do it.

What if they german communists have been able to meet up with some sort of you know pressure anyway like that might not have worked and it wouldn't have worked for one reason that lenin recognized the peasants. What are we gonna do we're gonna have to climb down now and if that means implementing capitalism again at least we're doing it and I know it was. I mean it was so horrifying that nobody else could even conceive of it even though the alternative what they ended up doing which is the only other thing that could have happened. They were either going to climb back down and negotiate a deal with the peasants to to compensate them for their surplus in order to maintain and expand. Industrialization and sit and urban life were either going to pay him for it which would have revolved bringing back capitalism or they were going to take it and the currency to be the only person to recognize that except for of course stalin who didn't care either way. He just wanted power and trotsky who essentially went crazy because he couldn't accept the reality of the choice put before him. It doesn't mean the october revolution was a mistake they needed to to revolt when they did.

It would either have been the bolsheviks or some sort of military rule and probably like an anti-semitic pogrom wave. Unlike anything we've seen before like an industrialized proto-holocaust. No they were right to revel when they did and they needed to win but every question after that is in the context of what happened then what happens with the end of world war one what happens with the war with poland. When that happens what happens in germany and at every point decisions have to be made by people. Then something isn't a mistake one way or the other because it's always contextualized and it's if it's a mistake or not. It boils down to like the options before you and in 1918 1917 there was no other option but revolution but then options change as the conditions change and I mean you know it can't there has to be something wrong at some point right with the soviet union or else. It'd still be here and if the answer to that is no. It's because you know they were choked by capitalism well. I'm sorry that means it never would have won like. It had to have been a combination of the decisions and actions of the of the people who were in power in the soviet union and that was in the capitalist world. It was an interplay of those two sets of decisions and actions. There had to have been mistakes on both on the side of the soviets. I did leave lincoln in the bardo.

It's great. I gotta read it again actually. I feel like I get more out of it. Now. I own it. I should definitely yeah. I should read it again thank you for the wreck.

Karensky was wildly cringe his entire approach to holding the war effort together and the provisional government together in the face of just absolute collapsing authority was just to cry to cry all the time have big emotional weepy speeches and just hope that everybody was to got too embarrassed for him to kick him out of power. It was yeah wildly very one of the cringier characters in In 20th century history he had to keep fighting the war because at that point the war was the raison d'etre of the realm of the provisional government of of the non-communist faction in in power. But when it comes to because people should just to get back to the thing about kavanaugh and that ruling that should tell you all you need to know about what will happen on election on the weeks after election night. If there gets to be a jump ball florida type situation they will definitely rule for trump no matter what and it'll work out. Fine libs will get mad they'll probably be another woman's march but that'll be it because who's going to the streets for joe. Bite especially if it winds its way through a court system and a court process that as it goes along cools everyone's ardor just the the blade the hissing blade sunk into the The water like think what would happen with with the barrett nomination and all that about we will burn dc to the ground if they try to fill rbg spot that was a threat but it's defused every moment after it's made that the conditions no longer obtain and if there's a process that leads you towards a conclusion and you accept broadly the legitimacy of those of those processes even if you disagree with the outcomes you will by the time the decisive moment occurs be fully disarmed and demoralized so that's what's going to happen if that occurs.

My thing is. I don't think it's going to be that close. I have decided that you can only psych yourself up too much psych yourself out too much because here's the thing about the polling deal and how polling is doesn't. Work.

Anymore polls have been basically as good as they ever were before and after 2016 and since in non-presidential races. I think that the specific confluence of insanely unlikely events that occurred in the 2016 election which included I think a lot of people probably lying about whether or not they were going to vote for trump because they were embarrassed by it which was a real thing. I think in 2016. The thing is I don't think that's the thing anymore because everybody who did that has either gotten on the train. Now there's part of the trump base who says you libs and who gets off on upsetting people or they're that cottier of college-educated white suburbanites who all the data seems to indicate in the last two years. Four years have shifted dramatically to the democrats that those people probably are just voting biden. Now they're not lying anymore if you call them and say they're voting for a democrat.

So. I think it's going to be not close enough for a shenanigans simply because it's going to be so many states that you'd have to do it in and the configuration of powers is different in each state. The ability of these guys to coordinate is I think totally unestablished and most importantly if you're members of the republican party and you're not directly tied to the trump machine. Part of you would be very relieved to see him go. I think and to be able to deal with biden fund raise off of a democratic president obstruct him. At every level.

 prevent them from doing anything that you don't want him to do and hey maybe bully them into doing some sort of a big bipartisan bipartisan. Entitlements cut that is that means republicans are no longer the party of austerity because democrats just did it too like both. They're. Both. The knife is bloody from both of them and biden will be president when it happens so it'll be totally you know branded as a at least bipartisan and maybe democratic proposal. That's great you're you're fine risking anything for him at that point when there's no direct pressure on you. That's the important thing here like if it's up to a few. Like senators or something. The pressure of the trump base over their political future will be enough probably to make them do what they're what they're scared to do what they're scared not to do.

But when you're talking about dozens and hundreds of judges and state legislators all over the country none of whom individually are going to get blamed if trump loses because the republicans I mean they're they're not going to turn. They're going to get mad at the democrats for stealing it which because they understand who their enemy is unlike confused. Liberals like when the the election of 2000 was legitimately stolen as such a thing could be and who do liberals blame by and large third-party voters. The 2000 the election of 2008 was by all measures of relatively fair free election in this country without any theft at all and republicans. Not only think that it was illegitimate. They blamed democrats for stealing it. They're gonna they're going to blame democrats. They're not going to blame their legislators especially if they legislators are able to pull off the relatively easy act of looking outraged at the outcome but not actually revealing what power they would have had hypothetically to intervene on behalf of trump and everybody. Just it's like he's doing a trust fall and everybody's hands just go away. I think that makes sense given where we are oh 

I need to commemorate this. Before I went on. Chris told me and I would not have known otherwise that this is my 100th kush vlog. I have spit over 100 hours of gibberish into the internet. Now feels like time well spent. Gotta say more than most of my time on this planet has been so that's cool one hundo nice round number pew pew. If you've watched all of them. Wow. I hope. I hope it has been in some way helpful. They're not all winners though of course. So we're going to do an election night show from our office where I've recorded with chris. Some of the vlogs here next tuesday. It's gonna be at a minimum. I believe me and felix chris and I think virgil in the studio and special guests aplenty. I think amber's gonna call in and we'll have other people adam friedland might be in the building. It's gonna be fun and it's gonna be interesting too because we're not gonna be able to organize it around a climactic moment of truth because we'll likely end without knowing.

Although I do think that florida will be the bellwether because florida vote counts their mail-in ballots ahead of time which means that they will have earlier faster and more complete results than a lot of the other swing states and that is the state where it's sort of a microcosm for the polling. In general. It's shown a solid consistent biting lead but at the same time you look at it and you think it's florida though and then you get. Some you'll get a few polls where oh what it's like within a point or something oh my god. And then you got the fact that you know they've got their felony disenfranchisement still in effect and they're going to challenge a ton of write-in or mail in ballots. But so I think if it looks like florida certainly florida is is called for biden on election night. I think you might be able to just lean back if you're if you care about the result. If you're terrified of providing of a of a trump term and find solace in the idea of a biden presidency. I I guess.

I envy you that a little bit because for me. I just I guess. I do want biden to win simply from aesthetically. I'm sick of talking about trump. I feel like there's not really much more going on there. His ability to accelerate us towards something. I think is pretty much his useful ability to accelerate us towards anything has been kind of spent. I feel like he is. I also I just kind of feel like he isn't the man for the moment. I feel like to preside over the kind of sustained collapse and then like reorder of this of of the economy like away from um small business ownership and employment by an employer towards this entirely decentralized a gig economy where everybody is some is is working for some you know a company that fronts them capital which nobody will have except for a few of the big corporations in exchange for them to basically turn into digital sharecroppers and that's going to suck and you don't want a guy in there banging. The dinner belt screaming all day and trying to edge people towards political conflict. You want a guy up there just with a richness of of grief just saying I'm sorry. I know I know it's terrible isn't it. I know I know oh. I feel the pain we weep together as a nation. That's to me.

That's what the system wants trump will not be prosecuted. They're not going to start. They're not going to break the understanding. The unwritten rule that nobody is responsible for anything they do in power because as soon as that's broken then all of a sudden The matrix of decision making of our leadership would be destroyed like impunity is built into being in power. It is an assumed condition that undergirds all of the other decisions you make because the question of what if people find out what if this it can go to the level of oh I might get in trouble oh I might lose my job oh yeah but it'll never get to the level of oh. I might go to jail for this they don't think that way thinking that way would could specific could actually change the way they govern.

They don't want to do that they don't want to tie their own hands so nope but if they call florida. I think I think biden's gonna win the whole shebang in like as in every state where it looks close like if they would if florida's called on election night he might win texas. He'll probably. I would say if florida goes to him. He will definitely win georgia probably definitely when arizona rather probably win georgia and is 50 50 for texas and that means he definitely wins north carolina and what goes off saying he gets back the entire. Great lakes firewall and I think that would be around 400 electoral votes. He would win iowa in that context. I think too in fact. I think he might win iowa anyway. The one that I think would be kind of funny if he didn't win is ohio which I honestly think c could see happening. I could see him when florida georgia texas and arizona and lose ohio just because of the way the demographics have changed there in the last eight years. But he could. I think he'll win iowa either way. Iowa. Iowa is a state that has been hit hard by specific trump policies in terms of the trade war that has hurt the price of corn very badly and then of course.

The horrible response to the tornado apocalypse that they had he's he's taking a actual hit from that and jody. Ernst also looks very bad there but of course if I would say this if florida is too close to call at the end of the night. I think you're still looking at a biden victory probably but if it's called for trump now you got to raise some eyebrows and think these things might not might be close enough that a tip ball could situation could emerge in which case referee tim. Donahue is going to come out and I think we all know what the outcome is going to be at that point and I hope you've already placed your bets beforehand apparently. Biden's looking bad in nevada and it'd be very interesting if he won arizona and lost nevada. Apparently. The the early voting situation in nevada isn't great for democrats. They're not getting back the kind of numbers that they were looking like they needed to to match.

The 2016 results so who knows shift latino's shift towards trump seems real which of course that makes people apoplectic because what about the cages what about the babies at the border we're americans the people you're talking about are americans that means that even though they're latino they're still americans which means that their understanding of themselves in a race is very much contingent on a million other ways that they understand themselves and in america. There's a huge cultural vortex towards being a guy who doesn't give a country without going insane and so it's a very persuasive political valence and trump embodies it for people of all of all religions and races and all this stuff. The difference is the way you experience race in this country is going to color how you take trumpet like he's also gaining among apparently black men not as much nearly as with latinos but still a shift and why because because the appeal is is a transcendent of race and the way you experience race can be very much put on a scale with a bunch of other identities and found to be by you less persuasive to direct you towards something which is why all the standpoint epistemology that undergirds so much identity politics and like theories of um like both understanding political reality and formulating praxis. Is hollow and insane because there is no totalized racial experience that over gerds every other part of a person's identity and decision-making matrix and so you cannot use that to determine the rightness or wrongness of someone's political beliefs because people specifically to talk about like trump's horrible stuff with immigration during the last debate trump kept saying about immigration to biden who built the cages and a lot of people were baffled by that because they said you can't say that when you're the one using them and no you can depending on what premise you're operating from the liberal premise is that this is a horrible thing that these are monstrous violations of human rights and that we need to stop them. The trump undergirding argument that a lot of people agree with regardless of race is look. We got to have immigration laws that means you're going to have cages because people are going to come and you can't trust them.

So what are you going to do with them. You can't trust them so you have to keep them in jail and how do. I know that that's true because even obama mr whiny whiny heart heartbreak makes crying about immigrants had them and built them and put people in them because we're going to put people in them and the question is do. We accept that it's necessary or do. We pretend to be sad about it because we're literally just virtue signaling to each other and that's a persuasive argument to people and there's no challenge to it from the liberals. There's only a further fake orchestra of of of pathos that if you think about it to think you guys built the cages you put kids in. Cages too makes you realize well. This is. He doesn't really care. He's not really sad about this you guys don't aren't really you're just using it as a weapon of convenience against republicans because that's all it actually matters and that's and therefore there's no content to any of our political ideology and it's merely a war of of sides and position and the thing is is that's true because they are not. They are not on other sides. It's a inner 

It's it's an internal conflict within capitalism about like the best way to like the the way the degree to which you have to soothe your conscience in the pursuit of the total market domination of the planet and that's I mean that's another expression. That's the way that it's perceived up politically. But that's an expression of a greater tactical question of how much can we squeeze. The peasants before this thing breaks down and we don't have any system at all. We get that thing that marx called the common ruin of the contending classes and that's the basic tactical or strategic argument between liberals and conservatives about these kind of things. But it's expressed politically as a moral question.

But it's all just imperial management. The border regime is a part of that it's not going anywhere. Neither party is interested in having it go anywhere there's no policies that are going to be pursued. They're going to make it go nowhere that means you need things like interdiction and you're going to have to house people especially if things keep getting bad in other parts of the world. Those parts that are convenient for us closer to the equator more likely to get hot and uninhabitable and flooded than us and they're gonna have to go somewhere. They cannot come here under the current regime they're not assimilatable.

Even the liberals understand that because what did obama do he deported a bunch of people and he built the cages and that's what biden will do and they know that and there's no liberal counter argument to it except to further undermine your moral co moral case which you think is so unimpeachable by highlighting its essential hypocrisy and mercenary use because the greater bet that the conservatives are making is that are the ones in power like the ones directing pressing like the accelerator button on here. The ones who say no like the mitch mcconnell types brick on the accelerator are doing so because they think there's nothing else to be gained by prolonging the fiction of democracy in the face of falling profits and rising ecological and instability. We there's enough momentum in the system for us to loot it while it's while it is still excellent and be confident that we can If we have to negotiate exits per individually and privately and the thing is they might not be wrong. I think they're really yeah. I don't know. I got to think about it more. I don't I got.

I think that like any in america anyway where we're like the reserve currency and we're in charge of like the institutions of global finance and we're we're the like the ref we're the referees of the global financial system. There needs to. I think that that one element of like a successful left immigration policy would be a recognition that a big part of it is going to have to be helping. People stay in the countries that they live in because that's where people want to live and the reason they can't live. There is because their countries are largely being destroyed on purpose by us and the thing about that though is that you know you. It's a frame that is xenophobic in a way like this keeps them out of here but in practice it's actually the hardest thing you can do which is get people if it would work is to get people on board with spending money outside of the united states which they hate doing. They hate it. There's a reason that people think that a foreign aid is like 25 of the federal budget when it's like less than one because they're just always imagining some foreigner with a big sack of rice living it up on their dime and but on merits.

That's the thing that has to happen like the world has to be habitable for people where they l where they live now because there's no situation where the entire world population becoming liquid and just moving across its surface is going to facilitate anything other than a techno regime of like essentially mass incarceration. Beyond anything we could imagine just large-scale human containment because people in flux like that are not able to resist. They don't have anything. They don't even have like the confidence of like ma of mastery of like a geographic area they're familiar with or access to community resources. They're at the mercy of just the global tide pole of capital and and the the um and at the mercy of its technological expressions at that point yeah like the the need for enough the need for those people to actually be like inputs into the economic system is going to be basically not nil. They will be disposable. There will be a beggman's a gambin's homo saucer and the funny thing is matt iglesias with his 100 billion with his billion americans book.

He even says he just coughs his mouth and says of course we'll They'll have to choose the type of immigrants we accept oh. It's like. I'm sorry isn't. He supposed to be advancing this left wing case for open borders and sneak it underneath the the sleeping maw of right wing reaction by by camouflaging it with this nice nationalism that they love so much. He still concedes a regime where yeah no we're gonna get the people who we who we need to like run our. Server farms and then you're still going to have to have massive a massive system of border enforcement. If you're doing that so it's it's not even the thing that his pathetic bad faith defenders claim this brilliant attempt just to to rebrand leftism. It's it's just more neoliberal. But but it's it's his fetish for a neoliberal reimagining of the city like he the reason. I think that he is so enthusiastic about markets is because he genuinely has absorbed the idea that everything good about like social life is to be found in the gentrified american urban center.

Therefore we need to facilitate that metastasis of that into like the the mean experience of being an american that that's his that's his conception and the reason he thinks that is because that is the place for the nietzsche's last man to live because it gives you the sociality. It gives you all of the the most superficial benefits of living socially access to different foods and entertainment options and things like that but with none of the spiritual connection and like community formation that comes around different social like dense social con relationships and he needs that to be the thing so that because he is trying to imagine what policy will benefit the most people and he has to imagine that people are him because we all imagine in some way that you know everyone is like us in a fundamental way. It's just we hope to get deeper at the root of it than him. He is only able he's so shallow. He can only get to no everybody should have this coffee shops and thai restaurants and stuff this this thing where I get a ver of as much of a varied experience in the most superficial way to to essentially imitate like a social existence well as I'm basically on my phone to him. That's valhalla that's utopia and so he wants everyone to live there and he imagines that the free marketization of urban life will will bring that about that. It's it's the restrictions on development that make that the case which is very much backwards. The the the restrictions are imposed by a governing ideology that is powered by a governing um mode of production and you know political economy and that is what dictates these regimes so sorry buddy. You gotta you gotta get down to the studs to make any of this stuff accessible because I think that that kind of dense urban lifestyle is is is. I've lived it. I think that that has benefits and I think that in a less alienated world it can be the basis for real social unity or social cohesion but it's certainly not something that is a panacea for any of the current horrors of life in this country and also and I mean the big thing to say.

You about iglesias is that you can see the outlines of a coming st ramping up of war with china as an option. Coming down the pipe like raytheon is putting out like yellow journalism now in order to get people behind this idea that we have to confront china we like the the our our our economy and our political order are going to push us towards conflict with china I know that you know there's the full full-fledged war would be bad for both of us and so that kind of thing can prevent an escalation but some degree of like rising tensions and military spending to go with it and military activity to you know keep the blood flowing through the american hegemony. Hegemonic circulatory system is gonna have to get expended and anybody who wants to help that along can stonk my donk south china sea and start a shooting war over koyan and matsu so that you can get a starbucks on every. But politically like trump blames china for the virus and I gotta tell you guys biden's gonna blame china too. Once he's in power sure there's gonna be trump but it's gonna keep being bad and that's going to work less and china's still going to be there and the incentives are going to be there on both parties to ramp it up as a way to express off the real horror of how badly this was. How badly we've been failed by the political leadership. They have to put it off on somebody and the other party is not ever going to be enough. China is going to be more and more the bipartisan source of the the place like look at the guys who people talk about is the successors to trump.

They're like guys like holly and cotton. They're not doubling down on his fake peacenik. Ramping up against china too as is trump. They're like any kind of non-interventionist paleoconservative strain and trumpism is getting squashed out by covet and by the by the the the psychic demand to find a suppository for our anger and it's and it's china china china. So I think the fifth column of neocons colonizing the dn. The democrats is a threat. I mean that thing about that is stuff like you know guys like bill crystal and from in the lincoln project. It's not that they are doing some sort of stealth takeover situation. It's that they are being absorbed. It's. It's it's not an in invasion.

It's it's a merger on on the on the fully conscious terms of both parties because the democratic plan has been since 2016 to turn the republican party into a party of purely white grievance and pull off every other sector of the ruling class away from other than like this. The buddy garrity beautiful boater type small bourgeois everybody with any real connection to the global financial order. The people who used to be the rockefeller wing of the party and absorb them into the democrats and make the republicans the white grievance party of the of the downwardly mobile middle. Lower upper like upper class and middle class and that means absorbing all these people and so the project now is is happening. It's been accelerated trump winning was actually the best thing that could have happened for that project and the reason this is happening.

More than anything is that so the it's not true to say that in the two-party system we have in this country that the two parties aren't actually representing like different agendas. They are they aren't. They're literally the same in their expression of in the expression of their political philosophy because there is actual conflict there. At the level of you know political economy and things like tax distribution and regulation. You know government structures actual differences that is true but those differences.

 are expressed through a political class that differs basically in its relationship to global capitalism. You have people connected to finance old money. The people who've been rich in america the longest and then the as the country filled in the regional powers that grew up the small producers small manufacturers and small like land holders and bourgeois. They grew up even though of course. Their relationship to global capital is very real. It is not perceived as such they may perceive in fact global capital as a conflict as as a competitor for them because in some ways it is the system as it equalizes it sacrifices some interest for others in order to maintain homeostasis like tariff regimes harm some internal companies or internal markets or internal re internal resources or whatever industries that's the word I'm looking for industries like some industries are harmed by a tariff regime. Others benefit their connection to the hulls of power and their you know the crucialness. The influence they have within the political system kind of dictates which is which and so there is a real conflict there and that has been for most of american history.

The contours of the actual battle between the two political parties. The new deal changed that the new deal brought the working class to the table as a third point away from small producers in small bourgeois and international capital. The working glass as such gained a seat at the table through their mass agitation around the great depression. They essentially they barged into the top levels of influence within the democratic party because they were able to assert their independent political agenda in the face of the crisis of the great depression that persisted for a while. After the wagner act. The nlrb put gave gave and at political level. The fusion of the top levels of the biggest politic labor unions with the democratic party happen. At the same time. Those relationships persisted until the 70s when the crisis of productivity the crisis of energy led the political order to at that point sever. The last connections between eight at that point. Mora bond labor movement that had lost its vitality lost its ability to assert itself as a as a equal partner.

In this in the in these political negotiations between these centers of political power and crawled off and died under the porch and we returned and since the 19 since reagan basically we have returned to the political order being a battle between finance capitalism and local local small bourgeois. Now the thing about that is that even though this is the conflict it's not expressed evenly through the parties. There are parts of both that support each but the acceleration of the culture war and the way the culture war. Beliefs are conditioned more than anything by social class and specifically college education we're getting to a point where they're the the the voters are polarizing around once again the small bourgeoisie and global capital and because now the issue are whether he went to college or not and the the party of global capital is the party of like college that becomes the party of you know minorities and or like seminars black people more than hispanics because that's a more fluid racial category and college-educated whites against this lump party of you know red-pilled 

I would say red-pilled minority males and then white white non-college-educated whites. Both above and beyo below like the poverty line or like the hundred thousand dollar line and this is a part of that process the assimilation of the old the the last vestige of the old eastern elite which formed the globalist part of the republican party because the war that started in the 60s between goldwater and rockefeller and which was won by reagan in 1980 for the side of the small producers and for the side of cultural reaction. It still has taken decades since then for the last tendrils to break away and trump has accelerated that process and now we are reaching a point where there will be less and less of a or at least if the democrats get what they want. There will be less and less of a republican like global capital connected party wing.

It'll be just pure like robert welch stuff and then you know pissed off guys and camo hats and stuff and then everybody else will be in the democrats. That's how they think that they can even without offering any alternative to austerity. Nightmare hell. World will be able to hold off hold on to power because they will have the demographics in their favor in that younger and younger people. Not only are they more diverse. They also hold cultural issues closer to their chat hearts because they've grown up with no other issues to talk about or consider to be on the table. Really all right I gotta get going here. Who's julius creen leave me alone everyone's yelling at me. I'm going off here now bye-bye.
