I have a new audio set up here with a uh mixer so that I can go from a microphone instead of using the laptop mic and I know a lot of people have uh been unhappy with the sound of these things at various times and I know that chris isn't particularly happy to be putting out things that don't have an optimal audio quality to them. He's got you know. He's got his own uh pride and his work and I respect that so hopefully this sounds good please let me know if it doesn't. It's not using the mic god damn. It damn it uh of course. I don't know how to do this oh boy. Here's how I gotta do tech support good luck wish me luck guys oh boy all right. I gotta close that I should close this. I need that I just don't need that where is that or where it is. It says that the input is the microphone so I don't know. I don't know what do you think because I don't really like holding this thing. I'd rather just talk all right whatever hopefully. This is adding something uh presumably. Chris will know if it sounds better from because he's an actual audiophile. I don't trust you. I don't trust you people.

You can hear the computer clicking so you know. It's not that well. I don't know what to do about that very sorry turn off computer input oh brother. Don't we all of tech support with grandpa. Here it's fun oh. I think this might be it. I think I might have fixed it. I don't know that might have helped does that help did I actually troubleshoot it. I think that might have worked okay great. I'm a genius guys folks. I'm a genius trouble has been shot by a super hacker.


I'm practically hugh jackman in the film swordfish over here very pleased with myself uh. So we're going to finish up black jackets. I think maybe tomorrow or wednesday but today I wanted to talk a little bit about some stuff that's been in my head about. Uh. The good old cultural superstructure and and how it's generated and I think you can really map out uh a a historic trajectory that kind of shows that uh we are living in a in a situation where culture is the thing that determines politics like politics and our laws and the real to the extent that there's human agency in this system it is being generated by that it's it's it's that political structure that we all invest ourselves in because it is the laws that keep us doing the things we do and I mean obviously the law is not uh outside of our politics. It's carried out by politics. We make it and unmake it according to power's desire but uh it is what tells people what to do because you're not operating internally. You're being manipulated from outside by the system and it has to tell you what to do and laws and politics are how you do that. It is the deliberation that gives human agency to uh its decisions to to to its actions on the markets or on in the world and the law is bending to the algorithm because there is no human resistance to it because we're all pushing no matter. What we think we're doing. We're all pushing in its direction because we have lost the war over control of things. Like politics. We are no longer in control of politics. The 20th century. The violence of the 20th century was essentially the human race in its final attempt to assert control of the machinery of capitalism and losing the war humanity lost world war. The human humanity lost the 20th century war. The long 20th century is one big long war between humans and the machine and the humans lost and what that means is that a lot of the assumptions that underlie politics in the 20th century are no longer operative and that of and that means that our analysis has to be updated or else we're not accounting for changing conditions and the main condition is that the assumptions about politics that are around that that we're operating under the ideas of elections. The ideas of cultural production pushing public opinion public opinion forming into action. You know the things we can actually do to feel like we're affecting things in a market economy where we aren't for the most part operating from class consciousness or class cooperation and the explosions of socialism and then fat the counter explosion of fascism and then the through line of sort of imperial domination that knitted them.

Together is all the human race in revulsion to the depredations of capitalism which on the one hand are creating this horrible destabilization and uh undermining of understandings of the world and human autonomy and uh like the the soul you know you want to get goofy about it uh against this force that's pulling it away from them or pulling out your ability to be a person oh god damn. It is it not working and the reason technology won the reason that the machine won is not because it was uh necessary for it to win because it wasn't for human advancement. It had to lose the final class war where humans come together to overthrow the algorithm uh it won that war not by annihilating us all a lot of people died but we also built structures of social order that allowed for a lot more people to live lives that were much more comfortable than had previously been possible and that comfort made possible by their technological control of space and time in the form of laws computers everything and we acceded to that because a lot of people got essentially bought off the closer they were to the machinery center. The more they could be bought off when that technology is used to do direct exploitation away from power in through the empire and that solution to the contradictions of capitalism. Uh pers was pursued as a way to ameliorate the anxieties of the of the lower and middle classes which then formalized into socialism and then fascism as conditions deteriorated even as the and that created a situation where first there was the uh the hobbesian war over uh access to imperial markets that made world war one inevitable and then once that happened uh made world war ii inevitable. By allowing this uh defeated germany the capacity to create a social engine powered by middle-class anxiety that could literally uh like seize control of capitalism and direct it to its own ends.

The same way that the bolsheviks were able to in russia and they extended their power to the extent that they could until capitalism contained them and the way the capitalism contained. The fascism was not by defeating it in world war ii it was by absorbing it in world war ii. It decapitated the nationalist sort of id of national socialism but it incorporated the structures of power that had been developed within it. The actual he people the human capital with the institutional knowledge who had built it were brought into the american imperium to administer a global empire that would have at its base the job of hyper-exploiting from the undeveloped areas of natural resources uh for the benefit of everyone broadly across class lines. Uh in the in the europe first and then in the anglo-american sphere and that meant that as all of the the crisis is within national capitalism erupted uh like popping up throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Uh you see over and over again capitalism absorbing the energy of its opponents to further its goals of extending itself until you get a situation after world war one where you have finally a a a geopolitical conflict between capital and humanity in the form of the first the russians and then and then you know the common turn and then the third world movement. After that. This coalition of forces resisting capitalism and then coming together to put down this like cancerous eruption from the middle that is fascism but then doing so by absorbing it now the path not taken after world war.

Ii. The one that maybe henry wallace or fdr would have pursued could actual cooperation with the soviets after the soviet fall of uh. After they filed. The nazis might have theoretically created a new a a a a a uh a world system that could slowly bl drain the fascist strain capitalism out it where they're out of it where sufficient uh cooperation between the conscious working classes of these various nations like the the new. The popular front basically persisting now that would have caused more war. We still would have had huge conflict in the 20th century. In fact we would have had an extension of conflict into a probably a third world war but it would have been one that could have been winnable for the people for humanity and instead we lost and I think the upshot of that and like I said the reason they lost. They destroyed who they had to destroy with the technology that had been created. But those who could be bought off were incorporated into the structure and then you have a superstructure created around that a cultural superstructure that incorporates these or these groups of people including the self-conscious working class of these advanced nations that it formed along marxist developmental lines exactly as he had predicted. These europe had these concentrations of people who thought of themselves as workers and they were everywhere through the world and the hope of after world war. Ii is that they could all come together but because stalin pursued this cover. My ass save my ass strategy where his well-being as ruler of russia and his regime's empowerment is more important than the his duty to the working. Classes of the world allows to create the conditions that make communism defeat inevitable because as soon as the bretton woods system of global trade is commissioned after world war ii. And the then the the under the the wildly underdeveloped and then recently war ravaged soviet union and then its allies in the underdeveloped third world were gonna have to go it alone and by going alone they were going to have to try to compete within the global system within capitalism on the and that required the state capitalist. Uh alienation of the labor of workers for the state's benefit which is why late the the stalin estate did not create a worker state.

It created a state where workers were in the same alienated position from their labor as they bet under capitalism but there was a socialized utility. There was a socialized decision mechanism free of capitalism that apportioned their alienated labor which is of course superior in every way to capitalism but still contains alienation that has to be socially solved. The only way to socially solve alienation if you're not going to to to alienate further with repression is treats is goodies which is why cruise ships turn to a consumer economy in the 50s was not some sort of betrayal. It was the only logical next step it had to happen in order to get people to work. You needed to give them incentives and those had to be market-based incentives and they were going to be less efficient than capitalism and so capitalism beat him in the fight for resources in the third world so that they could they beat him in creating the the global currency and that means that in the late 80s when the final crisis came and there was no more treats to give out and there was no more repression that could be exerted effectively. The whole thing shattered because they had not built a new soviet person because the people in the soviet union were still alienated the same way they'd been under capitalism and that was that was made inevitable and stalin decided to fight it out in material to to fight it out on uh uh economic grounds after because he had basically forsworn a real challenge for power on the field of battle but also uh a uh pressing forward of creating a coalition beyond russia's uh borders because they uh gave up on the the greeks they gave up on the greek communists in order to solidify the warsaw pac line the iron curtain line uh and then they uh they uh did not do any significant work to reach out to uh post-colonial regimes or or colonial resistance movements that were fight fighting to push off the last vestiges of formal colonialism. So as soon as the soviets have to fight us on consumer happiness as an index for uh can for building and maintaining a set a consensus reality. A consensual reality capitalism has coercion in the form of its cybernetic network of technology hooked to the profit motive but they also have social consent in a mass spectacle of of mediated existence that is generated by all that surplus that they get to play around with.

They have a dream factory we all get to live in the matrix. We all get to live in a fun house version of reality because we're living on the surplus extracted from others. We're living off of others pain now. I'm not saying stalin would have won that fight by the way probably would have lost. I'm just saying that we know he didn't win by not doing it. We know he didn't win by by he. The his position was not favorable to do what he did because soon enough what do you have the though the chinese gokami this.


But they were they were more social. They were just as much a feudal backwater. If not more so than russia had been vastly more. Uh they they had no developed capitalist mechanisms. No social relationships to create it through the uh the intensification of economic you know in action. They were absolutely. It was it was a it was a 2000 year old empire for christ's sake and so there's this massive crisis well how the hell do you get them to compete and what do they do. They had to kill like every system of accumulation. Does had to kill massive numbers of peasants and then they had to exercise the guilt from that with their uh with the cultural revolution. Just like the bolsheviks had to exercise uh the crime of uh the famines through the uh red terror through. I'm sorry not the red terror through uh the um the purges so one way or another.

This system is uh. It has it has won the one in the 20th century of the fight. Then the final terms of of final surrender of the human race were laid uh there in in the neoliberal order which is what the deal we got which is all right. This is the final crisis moment to set in conditions to move forward as we cybernetically uh our control to our ability to technologically control outstrips your ability to resist it and so all we really have to do is provide as minimal basis as possible for you to keep fulfilling your necessary social role without us creating it making it too big of a headache to put you down and to use repression to prevent you from doing that how much social coercion do we need to give you and uh and because the working classes of the world had been scattered to the winds. By the 20th century there was no coherent response and so the institutions dominated by capital as they were made a deal on capitol's behalf and that is the neo-liberal deal. The washington consensus what you can grab in the market will allow you dignity uh humanity. It will be. It will be the final uh hobbesian descent but it will be buffeted. It will it will be buffeted and prevented from just being a free-for-all collapse into chaos that doesn't serve capitalism's interests will give you enough treats basically to make it go down smooth. But of course. Those streets are going to be dwindling over time and so all of our post. Uh 89 politics has been this uh ritual ex exercising of all of our anxieties about the fact that we no longer control our destiny as a species and so we're all freaking losing it but and the reason we're losing.

It is because none of us can have identified where the enemy is because of the fact that we are all grasping for meaning through a miasma of post-class identity. Formations like we are declassed in a way in a fundamental way and what I mean by that is that when you talk about the gramscian model when you talk about superstructure as the place where you build power through counter hegemony. You're talking about an assumption that was in the context of gramsci in italy ants trying to answer the question. How do you take a country full of fearing peasant hicks. Uh and make it uh an effective and guide it towards socialism and his and his answer is well. You have to allow it to generate uh. It has to generate through the the lives of these people uh in the form of their interaction with culture because they do not and cannot experience the other more clarifying conditions of a working-class existence and so gramsci spoke to was trying to speak to the question. How do you try to get to socialism from there and it was build these counter institutions that can give you the legitimacy that the experience that you're not getting uh because people not enough people are in labor relations.

It's what do you do with the serfs. These questions always come down to what are we doing about the serves and I think we're in a situation now though where because the conditions the terms of conditions of human surrender that happened in the late late 20th century were such that human control of institutions at all levels would be ceded to the market. It meant that the culture that we're going to absorb will not contain actual working-class perspectives. Actual working class values concerns the kind of things that people would interact with in a culture and then use to clarify their actions in life because we're even though working-class people still make culture in their day-to-day lives in their interactions with uh elite culture uh and in their folk culture. Their technologically aided folk culture your tick tocks and stuff unlike in the 20th century uh throughout the world. This culture is not those working-class people do not experience their lives as working-class people 20th century people across the world when they thought of themselves they thought of themselves to some degree as a worker. It was a meaningful coherent sliver of their identity and it had a defined meaning and that was a notion of solidarity notions of democratic control of resources to social ends that was always there and that was always that means that people in all of the highest levels of our uh structures that the labor union heads people who wrote for television uh people who ran for office people who got stock jobs in the bureaucracy. Uh people who were living in the culture were living so were with an understanding of what the working class was who was in it and what its interests were and that made their actions in the public stage like who they voted for coherent and it also gave coherence to what they said when they were uh part of the superstructure. Like the working-class people who made it through to hollywood to write to write and to direct and to produce or and to act working-class people who who made up uh the the people who wrote on newspapers because that was a working-class job at first that was like people started on the streets selling the paper and then they started writing for it um and then of course the politicians like they were. They were people who uh had in many cases come through labor unions. For example so they had an understanding of who they were and what it meant to be that and then they lived that way. But we've given over now to the reagan revolution we gave over to that turn worldwide.

We all came to some conclusion. We are giving up control of our lives in exchange for treats and that was because that was the best deal. Anybody thought they could get at the time and the ones who didn't think that were crushed. If you thought you could fight on and you had integrity enough to do so. You did and you lost you were shelled out of the out of the uh the russian white house by yeltsin you were cooed you were sanctioned. You were embargoed. You were assassinated. You were fired. Your movement was destroyed from within by uh cointelpro or if you were willing to take the deal you got treats. If you were a post-war american worker. You got and you were white for specifically you got a house. You got a little quarter acre lot that was yours. It was like your homestead even though you couldn't grow crops on it and you couldn't live off of the land and so you still had to be a schmuck working. Every day you had that and things and that meant that over time you act that there was less of a coherent uh working-class element to this culture because the working class were feeling themselves their lives. Their lives were defined not by the work. They did but their inner their interaction with the market as homeowners as members of the capitalist class and that affected the way that they interacted with culture and it meant that by 1980 uh the the american working class was sort of bought off and repressed that way. Because remember there was a big strike wave that also happened and it was defeated and that was the stick and then the homeowner republic was the carrot and everybody was everyone made that decision on an individual basis. They were everyone it was every man for themselves and that's why when reagan said look you can't ask any more from the market. But we can gut some others the state fat that we're giving to these other people that aren't you we're going to let you compete more effectively in the market and you have a head start so let's go and they took the deal and why wouldn't they it was. The logical thing to do. Everybody made the logical choice which is why we're headed towards disaster because the end result of everybody making the logical choice under capitalism is apocalypse.

It's the end of the world. It's end of human civilization is our uh. It is our illogical choices that bind us together. It's our illogical choices that that define our relationship to the world and allow us to act not as individuals but as a part of a greater whole that can cooperate beyond compulsion and what we have to reckon with now when we're talking about what's the role of culture in politics and and what's the difference and that means where is the power where can you assert influence. I would argue that there is no place you can apply uh apply power to the culture. Now that can meaningfully interact because everybody including everyone who is trying all of their hardest to to affect change at that level can really act as a working-class person so that means this is not assist. The situation where you're creating counter gramsci encounter hegemony you're only powering the dynamo of the capitalist uh war. Uh the capitalist mystification machine because the center of gravity among everybody if the the voting public who is going to vote the most is going to be the most comfortable the people who are going to go through with earnestness. The ritual of voting are going to be the people closest to power hell. The ones at the very top don't just vote they extra vote by putting money in and that's because they feel like there's something that they're getting out of the transaction they feel. Like this civic ritual can gives me results my my contribution to this thing and my er. The earnestness of my contribution for this thing assumed in others is going to assure uh that we all move in the right direction but our experience of class is only post-modern. We experience our lives as consumers. We are we are a consumer nation and you uh array your your politics around the symbols of these that we get from the culture the mediated landscape that replace the practical realm where we used to define our world. Now everything is coming through this gauze.


This this this veil of maya that were that were that were covered by and so when we interact with politics it means we are. We will always be interacting with it on the conditions on the terms created by the most comfortable amongst us which is then going to be divided into two big camps because the beauty of the system is that it will always create this binary opposition. This polaris this polarization along two widely understood groups now in cap marxism. This polarization is supposed to go workers and uh capitalists and uh in a in the in the bernstein revisionist model that's how it's supposed to work. Eventually you get a system where there's two big political groups within a democratic uh. Uh structure one of them is a party of capital. The other is the party of workers and then they go at it and guess what the workers win because there's more of them that is the that's the uh sdp form form formula for uh reform that be that uh becomes revolutionary and what we have seen is that the the the combined and uneven development has made it so that all of the alienations within some capitalisms that form up nationally can be bought off with the pain of others elsewhere because you are getting you're not getting class consciousness untainted from nationalism. They are stuck together at the same level because they are also experiencing their lives through meaningful structures around these nations that they live as realities the same way they live their class as a reality um and so our we are getting to the point of like honestly.

We are getting to the point of critical class conflict in every or. I would say not class but sect conflict because what I'm saying is in all these societies where you have the format of democracy with some sort of flexibility within it to contain political uh. Uh alienation shy of like revolution and and con and violence. Uh you you're going to develop into an eventual situation where at the final moment of crisis there will be two groups two broad groups and that they will then come to violence over their inability to use the system to resolve the the the at that point. One or the other winner take all them or me contest for survival which is what everybody thinks they're in right. Now they're not but it feels that way that's our that's the frequency we're vibrating vibrating at because we all understand that that's where it has to end when it ends that way we don't know but it has to end at some point in the near future and that's going to be true in every country. But what that alignment is depends on the country and right. Now we have a situation where we have two sides shaping up along universal suffrage where the most comfortable are gonna vote and then that most comfortable is gonna break along one line of recognition into two others.

It's not like it's gonna all go to one end. It's gonna stay in the middle because this is this is not a this is not the conflict remember. This is the conflict being resolved. This is humanity being bought off from its own youth its own destruction. This it's the it's the um. It's the fent patch as we're being having our life force drained from us and so that means even though we are all still have a relationship to a means of production that means that we are that we are workers in some sense.

We experience those concepts class from a remove from a from an emotional connection from a from a level of reality that puts them on par or or actually no far below other more visceral attachments around nation around race around gender around all the other axis that make up everybody's personal sense of self that is not just defined by material interests that's only one that's only the basis for it once you have a material interest once you have a general interior interest. Everything that is built on top of that is is all based on all the other things that you're experiencing in your life and those things over time as capitalist technology overalls civilization humanity. Our lives become less social and more mediated and so our understanding of words like class and ideas like solidarity and and what politics can and should do like the entire note the entire structure of our of our understanding of the world through like a political lens. Uh is shaped more and more by what we view.

Not what we experience. What we experience is class exploitation that over time coalesces into class consciousness as we cooperate as workers. Now as we cooperate as workers. We do things like create a newspaper or have a political party and those political parties do things and those reporters. Those newspapers write about those things and that creates a context where we're acting and we're defining ourselves and through our interaction with the world and that includes voting and things like that and that is being generated by this working-class movement. But once the working-class movement is is destroyed where every every working class was put down everywhere from the soviet former soviet union to china to uh to latin america.

Uh uh of course in the united states uh in the form of paul volcker just putting a stake in the heart of the working class uh but only because they had already uh. There was no sufficient formation uh anywhere to defeat it because we were all too comfortable. The ones who were the most crucial to this system were too comfortable and had been made so everybody all the suffering was was scattered. The the deepest pools of suffering were not touched by political power. They were they were uh. They had never been allowed to to uh let sufficient capital formation or for stay to allow for uh the intensification of those cultural production that could interact with these structures and enforce a voice.


There was only ex. There was only the barrel of the gun. The vulcan shock was uh because remember so stalin thought he was at his best you want to give him credit stalin thought that at the end of world war ii he was giving he was doing a temporary armistice with the west he was saying look we're beat. We're in trouble uh. We got our asses kicked during that war. We're they have a bomb now. Let's just play on their terms until we recover a bit and that's the under the best uh the best faith. The the most charitable reading of stalin's thought process was that's what he was thinking if he cared that much but uh in hindsight.

We can see that uh no by cr by seating to that contest the soviets basically sealed their doom and so by the late like the the eastern black had been kept alive through the 70s by high oil prices and then uh western loans to try to create more uh com more efficiency in their economy uh and in so doing they uh became debtor nations and once you ratch and and of course the latin american countries that tried to do uh export or import substitution industrialization. Uh had done that basically at yankee credit uh and there that meant that all of those working-class parties that had emerged and had pursued power and had fought against the reactionary tide of uh the generals. Uh such power that was able to be concentrated was done so under the auspices of uh of this. Uh investment that was all that was all borrowed and as soon as that interest rate went up.

It just shattered uh the uh. It shattered the political legitimacy basically of all of these less efficient exploiters in the eastern bloc and so as soon as it became a contest for treats and there's no more. Uh the the west was going to make it harder to dispense treats uh under those econo with that political order well. Then the people would make the logical conclusion that the political order needed to go and so the legitimacy of these states collapsed and what happened is that all these people uh let the doors open to the trojan horse of capitalism that then just showed how much how little it had any concern for uh their out input in any of this.

But what this means for the culture question is since we're all interacting with the market uh interacting with culture as as consumers who are related to who the more we matter in the cultural discourse. The more likely we are to vote the more likely. We are to participate in political uh contests and volunteer and and participate uh by talking about it to each other and and writing and creating art about it. We are people who have a faith in the system that was bought off by the middle class boom and that is being undermined and that is being eroded every day but because of the uh accelerating pace of the technological coercive power of capital our ability to resist that is never been lower. There is no reflection in our lives of effective class resistance to capitalism. There's a democratic party but the democratic party does not represent in any way a class project. No one experiences that way there used to be a class project associated with the democratic party and it's through that lens that people still assume there is one and that structures their relationship to it.

But it's fake and what that means is that those comfortable homeowners who might have been a professional person might have been a factory worker. They view through the spectac spectacle of politics through this lens of credulity and that leans them to either be democrats or republicans and to accept one or the other of these frameworks of of blame and and and virtue. That is uh the political system acting out the question of who will be sacrificed to the god malik and the democrats and republicans fight over who is more worthy of molex extinguishment and so politics becomes a shadow war between these two cultural demons that we're trying to exercise because we have given up control of the system we do not believe in it which means we do not believe it bends to human ends. So we enter we're still in it because we have individual interests that we need to concern ourselves with and so everybody at every level participating people making art people making posts people making podcasts people running for office people making tv shows people trending topics people donating to campaigns. People volunteering for campaigns are all operating from this level of belief in the system.

Born of the fact that they were promised something their parents got something they were promised it and therefore they think that there's something they can do to get it back now. I would say that even if all the socialists in the world who say they're socialists now really understand that and have full clear understanding of themselves. No I am a worker sir. I am a worker. I will show you how. I'm a worker even if they're fully uh even if they know what that word means and they're using it correctly and it's not just like through the the lens that they've been observing it even if they are uh absolutely aware of themselves as workers. All they can do is act alongside everybody else because there's no collective thing to do except things like vote and we vote for parties made up of and voted in huge numbers by people who don't think of themselves as workers think of themselves as americans or taxpayers think themselves as entrepreneurs or would-be billionaires think of themselves as white or black or trans or male or female or anything things that everybody feels to some extent. But for these people. It's all there's no lived experience of class that is expressed through the culture.


It was killed because the conveyor belt from the working class to the creative class was cut because they said we're gonna get a deal to you humans. You guys who got a house congratulations you keep your house. You have that little bit of equity. You're not gonna be ground up immediately and fed into the slurry. You're not going to be turned into paste and bone meal congratulations. But of course you know over time. You're not all going to be able to uh live lives of luxury. But we're still going to have to figure out a way to to dole. This. These treats out that keeps you mutton heads in the game and the answer was the knowledge economy college. The idea that everyone believed at some basic level in the way they acted that the deal was now everybody for themselves.

But there is something you can do to ensure at least a minimum level of safety and comfort in life and that is go to college go to mother mother in college. Go there the way they said in the 19th century. Horace greeley said go west my son and grow up with the country. The 21st century answer after the extinguishment of the frontier the end of plenty the end of the myth and the need to start cannibalizing the human race. The answer became go to the go to college get a knowledge job. There's no more working through you're not. There's no more clearing land. There's no more struggle to be had. Your labor in most ways is superfluous.

It's getting more and more superfluous to these productions because we're doing it elsewhere with greater exploitation and greater uh uh uh profit. But that's just because we're develop. We're uh. We're going to where the profit is as profit declines. We're going and sucking up and hoovering up all the profits that can be extracted through exploitation through sheer gun to the head exploitation stripped of political legitimacy or political uh uh uh cons uh consent. But we don't live that way the ones who vote don't live that way so that means that us born into this world we want to be socialists. All that can mean is interacting with the issues of politics as defined by the democratic and republican parties which represent two formations of middle class nervous breakdown around failing uh the dying american dream and they are cosmopolitan uh cosmopolitan capital and provincial capital.

The brahmanas and the merchants as uh thomas piketty has called them. That's it and everyone else is along for the ride because with the death of the working class as an engine of politics uh after taft-hartley and and and then the neoliberal consensus and then the breaking of the labor movement and no more forward momentum in labor uh uh organizing and then offshoring removing labor's leverage because oh we're gonna close the the plant you're gonna go on strike good yeah that'll make it easier for us to get the machines out so that had been broken. There was politics had no working class in uh input. From the late 70s.

On it was gone you could argue from 72. It was gone and so the culture that we're interacting with is one that has not made by working class people. Some of them are the children of middle class homeowners who are in the middle working class but they went to college. We all went to college whether you're the son of a forklift driver or a electrician or a uh. Ad man or a cop your kid went to college and the idea was if you follow the rules absorb the etiquette and social mores that were imparted in these this finishing school and then gained some technical skill that could be priced into a market interaction. Then that you could get your own semblance of what of the of the upwardly mobile comfortable consumer based happiness that your parents had aspired to now. The 60s had seen the kids rebel against that and say oh no. I don't want that man.

I don't want your gray flannel suit man. But then at the end when the other when the alternative was was high gas prices and uh and inflation uh and and unemployment going up and higher taxes and and less fewer uh fewer vacation days and they were happy to be able to buy in at the ground floor of something because they didn't just get bought out at the uh. At the level of you know you got a a university tenure track position or uh you know a job in a uh like a think tank or whatever the uh the other part of that was that the cultural uh restrictions that had been implaced uh by sort of the middle class uh morality of those comfortable people in the middle uh their parents. Uh that was negotiable that could go because hey you're the guys who have money now you actually matter you set the terms and so people came around to the idea that okay. I can affect the liberation. I want which was always a consumer revelation because I never really lived a working class life. I lived in the suburbs. I lived as a homeowner's child as a little squire on the uh mansion. The a squat a little a little squire uh in the uh the countryside. A little little a little font leroy with with crushed velvet culottes skipping through the little suburban days and then they went to college and the jobs you got out of college that first generation. Those were jobs that were relatively intellectually rewarding gave you a degree of autonomy and uh uh some degree that some degree of belief that you chose your profession and they were well compensated but that was all predicated on this search for profit that was being funneled over to the extent. It could be and as increasing uh crisis reordered things the the treat faucet went down.


That's why everybody post world war. Ii is part of one generation we're all boomers. The only difference is over time our relationship to technology and our uh understanding of the horizons of our personal uh autonomy are different and that explains everything because everybody is seeing themselves as a consumer because that is what they were brought into the world. They were brought into post world. War. Two was one of for the people who went on to do politics the most and defined. These things not everybody but for the ones who were the center of gravity of american culture. It was a non-alienated time that's why they got instantly nostalgic because they were the only people who ever lived.

Non-alienated lives and college is the peak of non-alienation and everybody who came out of that machine went through a process of finding that on the other end of that was not the liberation that they'd been promised but just the same exploitation that their sucker ass dad had had but only with a shirt and tie and so you see the disaffection and cynicism of the xers. Then you see that just the the anxiety fest of the millennials and now just the dead-eyed nihilism of the zoomers. It's that horizon of human agency closing and politics that means everybody participating in politics is participating on those those terms the terms of of uh people who are were promised. A thing believed in a thing and are seeing the thing fail to deliver and are having a crisis one way or another of confidence in democracy and a uh and the systems that they've been uh consenting to participate in their whole lives and now they're starting to question them and what that and the way that they question them is defined basically at the wholesale level demographically and so you have democrats and republicans capital funding both of them but then the top level of one being finance capital in wall street and all these college-educated uh fancy types with very developed uh moral codes and and and very advance who consider themselves progressive who are the end result of the puritan cult of virtue because they have defined virtue publicly because god is dead and they are cosmopolitan capital and then there are people below and they set they fund out this whole shooting match.

But at a personal level. They are more favored to the democrats and then hollywood. Another formation around the creative types who didn't really want to do the dirty work of watching this machine sausage make itself they needed more express. They needed more than mere money. They needed a sense of creative outlet. They couldn't do a political outlet. They tried and failed but a creative outlet so hollywood and then science and technology like please just let me try to make the world better make. Let me allow me to express myself and so you had silicon valley and these formations all take and they create a vision of uh human liberation through the market that becomes the democratic orthodoxy and that is also world capital consuming the world and from the the the eye of the storm that turns into liberalism. Because these are the people who have been living most comfortably the longest and whose faith of the system is most deeply ingrained and then lower than them.

You have the people in the super structural relationships around them. They're kids usually like people in academia and politics which is also uh for working class. The the the children of working class people uh who uh also want a middle-class life and think of themselves as middle class and then pursue it. Joe biden is the perfect example of that joe biden is a guy who's like okay. My business is politics and that's my way of feeling like. I'm in charge of something and so that is that's who makes up those strata and then the voters at large are the lower level versions of that like k-9 like uh teachers uh and of course. There's also other people voting but at lower levels. People lower at the totem pole are voting at lower levels but even within that you have like in the black community. It's still arrayed around comfort the most comfortable black people vote and participate in politics.

The most. It's true with any kind of group you everywhere you want to uh define it. That's how voting is is structured and so our elections are just these coalitions of different people with different levels of affect for government participating in politics and the main thing you get out of that is democrats and republicans duking it out but now we're getting at one level at one end of the hysteria of q anon and the dream of uh the day of the rope and and uh all that and then the other you have the liberal ragnarok around creating like a a new like having a new cultural revolution around uh like racial justice and those are both expressions of these. This middle class breakdown this nervous breakdown among people who self-identify as beneficiaries of the system no matter what their job is or their background. They self-identify at a basic level as beneficiaries of the system who are trying to get a better deal and then you have people in socialist counter movements and even if they do believe that they have a class interest and they can only do they can only respond to the political structure that is being generated by this. This end state of uh neurotic breakdown like we're witnessing this this breakdown among the middle class mind and we're enmeshed in it in one way or another and we can only participate in it.


We can't stand we cannot participate in it without aiding. It is what I'm saying we are all providing energy for this this process. But we can't not do that because there's nothing else to do it just means that we have to put our gaze lower to the ground when we ask ourselves what is to be done at every point at every point. The vet the the usefulness of this critique in my mind. The usefulness of this line of thinking the usefulness of my whole approach to politics as a as a as your baseline understanding is that it clarifies things we all still have to make the exact same question uh decisions that we had to make yesterday no matter what we think about what's gonna happen. No matter where we think politics is grounded. No matter how we analyze any of these questions. We have the same daily challenges and they pose us always a question of what to choose to do and we choose wrong a lot of the time because our understanding of what's happening in front of us is in some critical way misaligned with reality and the the baggage we bring to our lives from our pseudolife. In this uh winchester mystery house of uh middle class neuroses ruling class I guess you would say neuroses either actually move ruling class or self-deluded ruling class neuroses. It makes you able to answer the question do I need to care about this a lot easier and when I see how much and I know in my own life how much time people spend preoccupied with questions that in the real scheme of things are irrelevant is that knowing that or being able to ask that question do I need to care about this can really free up mental real estate for other things like what to do about your direct life and how to apply your political uh anime. Your your your self-directed need to assert yourself in the world to assert your humanity in the world to express yourself as a being how are you going to satisfy that unquenchable fire and I think a lot of it gets misdirected by a sterile engagement with these these windmills so yeah.

That's where I'm at with the whole thing is that that our understanding of the gramscian counter hegemonic dynamic is not operative in the current circumstances in the united states. At least there has to be an emergent working class counter hegemony that breaks out of all of these structures that cannot come from these structures. So it can't be the democratic party. It can't be any of the issues that we're always arguing about because to get people to act from class consciousness. They have to take those moments when there's a conflict between their class interest as they understand it and their individual identity interest. There has to be a certain degree of uh of thickness of belief in notions of solidarity to withstand a real uh. Uh identity based attack so you can't participate in these questions without assuming that most people are going to put you in a file on one or the other side of this great divide. We have between the the cosmopolitans and the provincials uh the pubes in the grays. If anyone's read uh. The dark tower is as a bystander. We can only participate in it as either aloof bystanders or as people who have invested in one or the other at the level of fandom but then the point where fandom becomes self-identity. Like we have fused fandom to identity so that we care as much about how we define ourselves in what culture we consume as who we vote for and they mean the same thing and the voting has to be on the terms of this. This nervous breakdown. It has to be on the terms of this sterile culture war because that's the only game in town. It's that it's it's what the people in congress are voting on and it's what culture is producing. That's all we have so an emergent working class. Identity is going to form around practical questions of direct tactical use which means that these big structures of sorting that break us apart will not come into the question. It will not emerge to challenge and break apart uh trust because everyone will be in good faith working towards the vote. The local goal and they will put all that other stuff aside one way or the other. They will put that other aside and come to a consensus and then move forward from that and then that will create counter hegemony within it and we can all participate but for now we are in this we're suspended in this goo and it's our job to not go crazy in the goo. It's our job to not decide that we love the goo and that the goo is real and that the goo is life and then if we care enough about the goo that it's going to push us in through it. We're going to be able to move through the gu just by sheer willpower. We cannot we cannot will our way to anything we have to cooperate.

We have to humble ourselves and I'm not. I'm saying. I'm not doing a great job. I don't think a lot of us are but that's because we don't have anything to do and it's and it is action that brings clarity and then it's the lack of action that creates this neurosis. So we just have to not necessarily try to push to the very barrier of where we're gonna get resistance. But maybe just ask ourselves where can we put energy that will leave us feeling less shitty. All the time it could really come down to that because I honestly believe that if you're aware enough of the world and and and uh ideologically aligned enough with reality to understand the source of pain and alienation in your life and not to allow the the the specters of of middle class bourgeois breakdown to find them for you that you are seeking the best. I think that if you are on that side you're trying it's just you're also trying to pleasure yourself. We're all trying to pleasure ourselves and those two things are at cross purposes and by denying ourselves easy indulgence to distract and we have we. We can put ourselves to the task of like saying okay what what can I do to help and of course the question well okay help how emerges and the ego wants that to mean how can I do it in a way that is going to make a difference but you have to get rid of that part and if you get rid of that part it really focuses things because if you're going to act in spite of your having given up hope of it. Mattering you can act from the heart because you're severing yourself from your selfish devotion to an action because you will still feel better and now you'll know why as opposed to always wondering what it was and it requires the leap of faith.

That's why it can't be predicted or prescribed. That's why it's the realm of art more than politics and that's why I find myself in this weird position as a podcaster straddling the line as everybody blurs politics and art together turns culture and politics into the same slurry of of uh indulgence and distraction that I am a just a a part of that process that I am an avatar of that of that happening of the the podcast uh eruption is is people who have a desire to live at the pleasure of a system that benefits them but to be exempt from feeling guilty about it and there you can do that by trying to affect political change or by expressing yourself culturally and artistically and part of the problem for a lot of people is that politic the political horizons got so sh. Uh were constricted so quite fast that all faith in that avenue collapsed almost overnight leaving only the pursuit of art by the by the way by the canny you know by the ones who didn't want to be cringe. But not most people aren't very talented is the thing and it'd be one thing if you wanted to express yourself as a hobby but having to make it your career means having a deep investment in your ability to do it that makes doing it less fun and more scary and then people just get paralyzed. I know I did before that choice until a new thing comes around where hey I could just talk about politics and it'll be entertaining and that's like artistic right. It's like art adjacent. It's making people happy which is better than making them sad and people get to acknowledge me and I get some of the validation that I can now only seek virtually because our conditions are pretty much set unless you get wildly lucky and become an avatar for a whole generation of people so that's why I find myself now having to refine and be like all right.

If this is gonna be worth doing it has to be meaningful because otherwise it just makes me feel bad and I can't distract myself anymore from what is the source of that because I know it and that is the power that's how real class consciousness and right action are formed is that you get stripped to a sanctuary awareness point and an interaction with reality that is sharp enough and you maintain and you retain that association and it becomes this plangent chord that your brain plays as you in order encounter the world and it keeps you grounded in a truth that you use to identify everything that happens around you and so now. I'm like I mean am i. I probably have to make something that's like more labor-intensive uh more risky than whatever this is and that's what I'm trying to do. And I think that yeah the degree to which I feel any anxiety right now in my life. It is in trying to manage that uh that tension between the the manifest indulgences that I can uh pursue and my drive to to actually do that and I'll probably just walk that I'll probably end up walking that tightrope for the rest of my life. One way or another unless there's a big phase shift which very well could happen. But I just trust that I'm walking it for now. I trust that I am holding a balance between and not being pulled from one way or the other and that that's all I can really go on is that homing beacon in my stomach.

But I do think things are going to change for everybody in a relatively uh the relatively near future not catastrophically necessarily but in a way that when you look back on it you will kind of be like oh damn. I mean hasn't that been true of the last year and that's of course the the dread the poisonous mushroom that uh felix identified when he says everything stays the same but gets worse and that's the perfect description of it. But that's still motion and you and you don't get motion all at once. You get motion through a a a gathering towards a breaking point and we're all going to have to act in that moment and the decisions we make are going to be guided by what we've been doing until that moment comes and the other thing is is that moment's not going to be the same one for everybody. That's not going to be the same one. For everybody that moment is going to be the accumulation of moments everybody. The the the twig is snapping under everybody but it is doing so at an uneven rate but it is happening to everybody in small and big ways and so that means that we are getting more and more opportunities to confront moments and not to try to bury our head from them or try to incorporate them into our fantasy narratives which is another bad thing. You could do suffusing your action with like the will drawn from conviction and that is what we lack the best lack all conviction because there is just so much information isn't there and there's so much of an expectation that we can come to a logical mastery of the moment that will justify our action because there's no other reason to do anything that more than anything is what we've been taught. There's no other reason to do anything other than it is logical and what logical means is in my self-interest in the broad scope. Logical means to my self-interest as I define it that means nobody believes in any institutions that means they cannot believe in working within them or resisting them because that would be involving themselves in other institutions that they don't believe in. But I just I i keep myself at the moment balanced on the beam because things are good for me largely I am pretty content and I do feel like I am moving forward and then it's only when I kind of start self-doubt kicking in and sort of sloth that it gets bad. But you know then I i kick myself. I pick myself up and get back in the race. I pick myself up and get back in the race that's life. I get cocked down and I get up again never going to keep me down so yeah stick around if you want more of these nuggets of content that I'm trying to craft into something beautiful for someone's eyes and feel like. It's true yes jack black. Jackman probably wednesday. I did finish it so we'll talk about the whole thing you.
