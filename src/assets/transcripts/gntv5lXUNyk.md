Foreign Fearless men who jump and die men who mean just what they say the brave men of the Green Beret Silver Wings. Upon their chests. These are men. America's Best 100 men we test today but only three when the Green Beret training to live off Nature's land trained in combat hand to hand men who'd reign and fight and day courage takes from the Greenberg Ray Silver Wings. Upon their chest. These are men Americans best 100 men we'll test today but only three when the green bow Ray but Silver Wing back at home. A long life Waits her Green Beret has met his fate. He has died for those oppressed leaving her. His last requests put Silver Wings on my son's chest make him one of America's Best. He'll be the one. They test one day and then he'll be a Green Beret hello. It seems like the question that is at the center of all political discourse.

But they can't really be named and it's named around and it's certainly gestured towards. But it's rarely confronted directly is what do. We do about the small whites and when I say small whites I mean in the sense of the class formation that emerges in a settler Colonial project where you have the big Bourgeois. Then you have the to one way or another prostrated laboring flask and then he got those ones. Stuck in the Middle and the thing about them is that they are. They are constitutionally denied.

The possibility of solidarity imagined or real with anyone outside of their family unit maybe or or Clan more broadly because they are in competition and often employ. They employ people below them and then they're also at the whim of an economy that is set by those above them and it makes them an incredibly powerful political block when they mobilize and what they when they mobilize what they want is they want to create a world that cannot be. Now you can argue that that's also what the working class has in its vision for socialism. But their two faces really of a um of a millenniary apocalyptic confrontation with capitalism as such the the the the working class politics socialism. Whatever we want to call it that emerged in the 19th century and then gutted out in the late 20th was.

This class organized revolt against capitalism with the idea of destroying the current order and then replacing it with a vision of social harmony generated by that which had led would have led to Triumph social solidarity and it is the continuation and the completion of the Christian millennium Christ's return as the return to a state of Paradise. Now the the small Bourgeois also has a millenniary horizon but it is a negative one because it denies fundamentally the cons the very concept of um solidarity. Its activism must be driving towards a ecstatic annihilation. Yes there is of course there's a there all these groups have positive Visions I mean the Nazis had this idea that they were going to turn the turn of Eastern Europe into a re. A technological re- performance of the Teutonic Knights conquest of the old Pagan Baltic and also the American conquest of the western United States with colonists bravely settling this land and then both dominating and fighting with a arrested native population but that is just a It's a chimera for the deeper desire which is annihilation because that thing is not stable it cannot be stabilized absent solidarity and so it cannot really produce a political imagination or politics geared towards.

Conquering the questions of scarcity and technology and Human Social reproduction that are posed by a crisis capitalism. It is it is expanding until being stopped and that stopping is is the moment that is being sought and it is a death in the process of conquest and domination. It is fighting the battle of Armageddon and that's who is in control of our political system right. Now that's why a lot of people love to use the word fascism I do not because I really have at this point convinced myself. That fascism is only useful to describe small white social crisis in conditions that are unique to Inner Warrior. We still have this crisis of Death Drive in the small white population embedded always within capitalism. Only in crisis is it exposed but this crisis is not the same as the crisis of the 1920s and 30s. It is a crisis among a de-politicized post-mass politics culture in which spectacle and observation and passivity have replaced political and social participation and so to use. The word. Fascism is to assume a degree of social February and potency that doesn't exist but the impulse is there and the drive to annihilate and to destroy the systems that we have is there too. And it is what the Liberals and the left and everyone is passively observing and freaking out about because they are the only group of people in American politics who are able to assert an independent influence on political events. Everyone else is reacting and the reason they're able to act the reason that they're able to do things that are just outside of the capacity. Not not not that they couldn't do them abstractly but that they are unable to do them because of who they are and how the position they are in textures and and shapes them into being people who just can't do certain things. The reason they can push past lines and break through things is because they have an apocalyptic Vision.

[10:25](https://youtu.be/gntv5lXUNyk?t=10m25s)

That is as I said positive to them now as I'm saying. It's actually Death Drive. It's actually Annihilation. It's it's actually fighting until dying. It's the warrior dream of the the Pagan cultures that provided the real social structure that Christianity and all these other ideas were just merely like placed on top of you. Know. Like meaning is found in in the struggle and on the battlefield and and ecstasy and final communion come in death through death.

With Honor but like it has its own positive fantasy because we are allowed any fantasy we want we can generate and maintain any fantasy we want and there is a positive apocalyptic face to the small white political project you see it when like poorer more struggling Q Anon people talk about because like yeah a lot of the Q a people love to talk about it as this as the cue moment as as the the final overthrow of American democracy as the cleansing fire of righteousness. But it is also going to bring about the end of the end of sickness because all of the cures that have been hidden from us by our rulers the end of a debt slavery. A jubilee like they talk about it in the classic terms of a socialist millennium because not everybody in the small white Coalition has the same conditions and at the edges there is a positive vision and so people can vote and push it. Forward at every level and believe that they are pushing for a a positive version of an apocalypse but understanding that they are seeking the end to a system and that they are able to do that unimpeded. Because no other group of political actors in America has a positive vision of apocalypse. We see an apocalypse coming but we can only imagine it in a as a process of material cataclysm and and death and decline because that spiritual element of it has been dissipated out of our ability to socially reproduce it.

Like you can see it with the debt ceiling you can see it with so many issues no matter how radical you are and how radical your anti-capitalism is if you are someone who like ascribes to the broader concept of leftism in the United States and even if you hate the Democratic party and you really do hate them and you really do want to see them defeated and you really do think you hate capitalism and the system. We have the process the prospect of it actually breaking up something actually dramatically. Disruptive occurring is terrifying only terrifying there is no possibility of a light emerging from that struggle. So the the the you end up finding yourself rooting for the Democrats to keep a lid on everything. Even if you don't think that the lid is good or that the thing we're keeping going is good. You are still terrified of anything else because you can only imagine it negatively but the small whites can imagine a cataclysmic rupture positively and so they can play cards with a full deck and with both hands untied and that means then that in the stasis that we're in where oh increasingly there is no place to go with deep political questions and economic questions like look at the that ceiling thing. At the end they were unable to really move the ball in any way. They have that there is no even rhetorical ability to imagine a drastic change to public outlays or any of these big things because all that money is spoken for by different interest groups that have a lock on a seat at the table and they are and politics is now giving up those rents and distributing them into to one group or another.

So that is why the politics get increasingly frenetic and this fantasy of just overturning elections and ending democracies. We know it becomes more acute but only among those people who don't think they would lose from that confrontation and that is partially due to Blind Faith and just a fully Pro. The propagandized beliefs of people who have been pandered to by every major element of culture and politics and economics their entire lives and are now only really freaking out because one part of that what they see on. TV basically is no longer reflecting their values because they're old and they are very pissed about that and they're going to try to. They would be happy to bring everything down to stop that they are the only people for whom that can be said. Now of course I must stress what they're willing to do is just vote for increasingly outlandish characters. They're not going to get in the streets or not enough of them to do anything other than be a nuisance. We know that by now we've seen it people will come out for what they think are tailgate parties and that's it and it's and anything that would be more a dramatic. A more dramatic conflict with actual state power is something that they are simply not capable of any more than any other element of our deep. Depoliticized desocialized American population care yeah but they will vote for people who are more and more true. Believers who and more more and more are willing to go farther than people before them and heighten contradictions and so like they and and only because they don't have a self-limiter that every other elected official. Everybody else who's voting for a politician has and if there's going to be any more actors to emerge on the scene.

It has to be people who have a positive vision of Apocalypse who have and I who can Envision a situation when radical change is not simply misery and it's not simply pointless Carnage but perhaps constructive and useful trauma that could be built from problem is the the the the the scared housebound types who make up the The cultural Vanguard of a left-wing response to the current conditions have turned trauma into the worst possible thing to encounter instead of what it is the actual building blocks of not only civilization but individual personality and identity and like what is a Doomer. That's a Doomer is somebody not who thinks that things are going to get worse because if you have eyes in your head that should be pretty obvious. It's somebody who who thinks that that is the only thing that happens that a general downward trajectory from one or two indices like demographic changes are can only be collectively and accumulatively negative so yeah if you're if you're if you're accusing everybody of being a Doomer you got to ask yourself well. What is my Horizon like what what do I see as as as a trial that leads to light rather than Darkness at the end of a tunnel because if you don't have one I mean that's fine you know as I said it's totally understandable to to think that we've extinguished the light you know within us and are now just playing out. A string. I don't agree with that. But I understand how that conclusion can be drawn but then you just have to accept that the only actors will be these people.

Everything else will be a a reactive a frantic reactive response to that to those actions and a lot of it boils down to the fact that we have never really built in the west where you know we've been at the center of the process of capital accumulation primitive accumulation that that then stands up these class class compositions that are treaty relationships. Truce is in a class war and then generate culture based on those relationships at that Center everyone but the most exploited and immiserated become to one degree or another personally invested in dynamics that are generated by modernity or post-modernity wherever you find yourself and so a threat to them appears existential and faith in a positive apocalypse is hard to sustain foreign. So yeah I would say I I don't predict the future. I don't like doing that. But the future of American political politics I think in the near future is is going to be everybody no matter what they think they're doing no matter what they think their commitments are reacting to this political project that has at its base. The desire to bring everything down and the question becomes is the goal to prevent that or is the goal to prepare for a alternate response to that and those are personal questions as I have said all right.

Let's do some cards we've got a military asset. The M1 A1 Abrams tank ugh this guy sucks compared to the M60 get it out of here. This guy is not nearly as elegant and cool very very unattractive aesthetically unpleasing. It's. It's sad that we don't have a more a cooler looking military considering how much money we we We spend on this M1A1 Abrams tank powered by a revolutionary gas turbine engine. The M1A the M1A1 is a heavy main battle tank with a Speed and Agility of a light armor vehicle with 150 with 1 500 horsepower. The Abrams can Traverse flat terrain at 45 miles per hour rugged terrain poses no problems for its unique Hydro pneumatic suspension system. This literally sounds like it's a brochure at a defense. Expo. The Abrams was the stalwart of the Operation Desert Storm ground attack as I've said the other one's cooler. The other main American battle tank is way.

Cooler manufacturer General Dynamics speed 41.5 miles per hour max excuse me. It says here in the copy 45 miles per hour that is a discretion that is a this that's a problem range 269 miles. Armament 120 millimeter Gun 2 7.62 millimeter machine guns and one 50 caliber machine gun crew of four. All right we've got military skill Greenwich Mean Time. This is pretty funny come on knowing what Greenwich mean time is is. I guess a skill I mean if if you if you if you can just look at a clock. I don't really know is that a skill looking at a clock I got clock watching class. Honestly. They might be teaching people clock watching in the military. At this point Greenwich Mean Time University time or I'm sorry universal time or Greenwich mean time is the time of day at the prime meridium zero degrees longitude which runs through Greenwich England at 5 PM 1700 hours London England time. It is noon 1200 in Washington DC USA and Toronto Canada and 3 A.M 0-300. The next day in Sydney Australia to avoid confusion universal time is used as a worldwide standard for navigation and scientific purposes called Zulu Time by the U.S military that's cooler that sounds better than Greenwich Mean Time. This standard allows for the worldwide coordination of missions such as Operation Desert Storm. Of course I wonder how in the era of great yeah the era that we mapped the the the the century that we mapped the globe. They were like where are we putting this thing Ireland how about indeed sir we've got radar operators.

There's radar operators we just got the M1 Abrams. It literally just happened. It just happened whether they are flying high above the grounds and clouds and aoax surveillance aircraft or we're located on the ground. At fix a radar sites. Radar operate radar operators graphically Illustrated their importance on the electronic Battlefield. During Operation Desert Storm. The men and women of the U.S army navy and Air Force who pinpoint the enemy or monitor air traffic on their radar screens proved to be invaluable in Modern Warfare. I'm sure that's what they tell themselves. What did you do in the war. I was looking at a screen cool right obviously. But why is the why is the Greenwich Observatory where they're making time calculations.

It's all connected it's like the eye opened up. Sauron's eye opened up in like around 19 1850 in in London in England. They they've been doing occult rituals for hundreds of years to open Satan's eyeball and anus so that they could peer across the globe and at itself they created a an emptiness a hollowness at the center of their social structure and their and their belief that the liberal capitalist ideal which evacuates from the actual meaningful Zone Of Human Action any sense of commitment responsibility to anyone else which is God. That is what religion historically is. It is a ritual reinscribement of obligations and that means things you have to do day to day in your life and and and and British political economy of the 19th century on top of the machine of industrial cap Colonial capitalism said no everywhere that matters there is no obligation to anyone else and so they created a emptiness a vacuum at the center of their world that was eventually filled as all vacuums are because there is spontaneous emergence from nothingness. We know that that's how we have life on Earth and the spontaneous thing that emerged at the empty heart of British political economy is the self-aware algorithm of profit as God.

[29:51](https://youtu.be/gntv5lXUNyk?t=29m51s)

Here we go. We've got government United Nations sanctions. Oh don't we love the sanctions that the United Nations drop we love it when the U.N throws some sanctions out there. Prior to the Operation Desert Storm. The UN called for sanctions on only two occasions embargoes against Southern Rhodesia now Zimbabwe from 1960 67 to 1977 and an arms embargo against South Africa in 1977. The the sanctions against Iraq were adopted by the security Council in the form of resolutions. They prevented the transportation of commercial items by means of air sea and land to and from Iraq. The purpose of the sanctions was to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. That's nice because you've got this Tradition. Now. It's like what we're we're doing sanctions to stop apartheid that's basically the same thing as saving our precious oil. Reserves in Saudi Arabia in Kuwait yeah.

The fact that there was like an actual Global isolation of first Rhodesia and then South Africa is used a lot as evidence of that there really is like Global communism right that like no matter what we say the actual goal of Communism is this are being pursued by our largest institutions but you know that's because the reactionary who who cannot absorb the reality of moving through space dialectically and and the pro the dialectical nature of unfolding Social Development sees a twine phenomenon and flattens it into a single aspect that is judeo bolshevism. It's it's the fundamental analysis that says both our highest Elites and our poorest are in a collision are in collusion together to destroy who those in the middle. But the reality is is that capitalism is the creation of a fully totalized system and that is also the goal of communism and they and the one emerges out of the other. But only one of them has Departed the world stage but anything that serves now what is now a liberalizing globalizing social.

Agenda is identified with this non-existent communism because the particularist small Bourgeois resists the globalization of capital even though that is the Drive of capital which is why another reason that the small whites can actually coherently oppose it and and seek its destruction because at a fundamental level even though they were sustained by it and and generated by it. They are able to operate with a conscious rejection of that relationship because they have access to fixed local Capital that allows them to bake their own reality because that's what capital lets you do capitalism lets you make your own reality but only on capitalism's terms. That's not how it is observed and it's not as how it is processed by the people living within it. It's psychology.

It's psychologized and particularized and pathologized and an assumption of autonomy is is preserved but that is illusory I guess yeah those middle. Those middle men are on the long term on The Chopping Block because it's not a straight line but it is a general Push Pull of humans into two great groups. It has not happened and it probably will not happen before the internal contradictions lead to a collapse. But it is a drive within it and the small whites are driven by the belief that they or their descendants will end up on the wrong side of that sorting mechanism unless they intervene to break it up.

Geography Jordan we got Jordan the old hashemites hashemites. They were the They were the the tribe that the the British picked up plucked up to rule the whole place but the The Sounds kick their asses out of Saudi Arabia and then the Brits and Americans had to make another deal with the Saudis. The hashemite kingdom of Jordan Jordan is geographically between Iraq and Israel in between a rock and a hard place and all right. In the Six Days War of 1967. Israel captured the West Bank of the Jordan River sending hundred large numbers of Palestinians into Jordan. In 1971 King Hussein forced the withdrawal from Jordan of Palestinian Palestine Liberation Organization officials and troops Black September I call it that it's not in the card but that's what it was called since the start of Operation Desert Storm Jordan has been pushing for a peaceful solution. Hey guys can you chill geographic area. 37 000 20 297 square miles population 4.1 million language is Arabic and English predominant religions Islam and Christianity. I guess those are Armenians there or something syrians. Assyrians also Capital Amman government type constitutional monarchy head of government King Hussein.

The first the sauds came barreling out of the desert with an army of religious fanatics. The salophists and just drove the hashemites almost into the ocean and then based required and then made the West deal with them and of course what happened the the Saudi Elite. Do they dedicate themselves to pursuing the salafis vision of Islam No they pursued them they they commit themselves to hedonistic luxury because that's what money does that's what it does. It makes this it lessens the sting of everyday life that religious visions and a religious conception of of of time and value are meant to allay and so why do you need it of course eventually that Gap between the relatively suffering people at the base who still have religious beliefs and the royal family which becomes eventually just hollowed out like the elites of any other any social order are over time buy their access to luxury They realize oh Iranian Revolution and it helped lead to this project of political Islam being exported and turned into a projection of Saudi state power and a way to vent the steam of pissed off young believers to give them new terrains to fight it and in this they were of course aided by the United States whose interests completely coincided on that point because it meant undermining secular socialist and nationalist political movements in the rest of the Muslim world. It is true. The French say that Kaaba a bunch of a bunch of French Foreign Service guys were brought to Mecca. They had to do a quickie conversion to Islam to be led into the City and then they just sent him into the basement of the Kaaba to just murk all these guys. I think they smuggled in a bunch of wine too and got shit-faced afterwards.

[38:29](https://youtu.be/gntv5lXUNyk?t=38m29s)

All right um we've got the F-15 Eagle. Oh this this was another archetypal fighter like just a very sharp lines crisp aesthetically pleasing way better than the gross ones. We have now people carrying a variety of air-to-air Weaponry. The eagle is an extremely maneuverable tactical fighter designed to gain air superiority in any combat zone that's right think of a combat zone F-15 Eagle. It will be extremely maneuverable in that situation. It can gain air superiority anywhere in a vacuum where there's no air it'll still get superiority an Operation Desert Storm. It was employed as a fighter cover for bombers and to engage enemy aircraft.

It is powered by two turbine turbofan engines with 23 830 pounds of thrust in each that's a lot of thrust. The first Iraqi aircraft shot down was hit by a sparrow missile fired by a usf-15 so there were a few like half-assed dog fights during Persian golf. I think it's one of the last times we had any kind of real air-to-air Combat in the US Military manufacturer McDonald Douglas unless they're doing over Ukraine that they're keeping quiet speed Mach 2.5 max range two points. 2876 miles Armament one 20 millimeter Gatling gun four Sparrow missiles or eight aim t220as plus four Sidewinder missiles crew one. The Sidewinder missile was a big deal in the 90s. You don't hear about it so much anymore but the sidewinders and then it was the tomahawk cruise missile which you heard a lot about both of which have been largely made obsolete by drones. I think there has I think there was some air combat between us and Russian forces or Syrian forces over Syria.

Not sure though military asset the USS Missouri where the end of World War II was officially declared where they signed the surrender documents designation is that a b or an R that's a b b I gotta get. I gotta get goddamn bifocals folks it's over for me bye-bye bb63 USS Missouri one of four Iowa class ships which are the second largest battleships ever built. The USS Missouri sought action World War II. She was famous as the ship on which the Japanese signed their surrender in 1945. The U.S Missouri's 16-inch guns are the most awesome of her compliment of weapons and were used against Iraqi. Military Targets in Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm HomePort is Long Beach California. It is indeed the Appomattox Courthouse of boats displacement 57 350 tons full load that's a big load length 867 feet speed. 33 knots armid nine 16-inch guns 12 6-inch guns with four Phalanx seawees. Tomahawk and Harpoon missiles crew 1570 40 Marines that's right the last time to date that a naval Naval Cannon has been used you're saying I would believe that I like that 16 mil the 16 inch guns are the most awesome of her compliment. That's good. That's a decent prose well done intelligent file chemical and biological warfare. Oh boy put a pin in this one.

[42:29](https://youtu.be/gntv5lXUNyk?t=42m29s)

This one's gonna come back to bite us all in the ass pretty hard oh boy yeah. Chemical and biological weapons are frightening but overrated threats to military personnel don't worry about it oh yeah. I think I read this one before. It's basically poo-pooing the idea that they're danger which is very funny that we then went and had to invade Iraq to save us for this. Because the nuclear case was always thin it was the it was the it was it's based on the tubes which were that was a lie. The tubes rely and of course the uranium was a lie.

The only real thing they had was some stuff from the 90s that maybe hadn't been destroyed and that's the only thing they found either oh. Here we go geography the United Kingdom hello hello I hope Australia with the signing of the Magna Carta. In 15 12 15 England paved away for Morton democracies to exist didn't they. During the 19th century the United Kingdom as the most powerful Kingdom had so many territories scattered throughout the world that the sun did not set on the British bloody Empire isn't it. The United Nations has a permanency on the U.N security Council and Supply more than 50 000 troops and that turned Australian there.

Fifty thousand troops in material for Operation Desert Storm get them off of the security Council. What are you doing take away their nukes and take them off the security. Council. You're a Backwater get out of here good day replace them with India geographic area 94 247 square miles population 57 million languages English Welsh Gaelic. The West speak Welsh but does anyone speak what Scott Scots Gaelic I know they don't speak in Northern Ireland predominant religions out of instead of people who are just doing it to be annoying which I'm sure there are plenty of like the French in Quebec predominant religions. Anglicanism and Roman Catholicism Islam is in there now baby get in there get in there Islam Hinduism too Capital London government type constitutional monarchy head of government prime minister Jordan major yeah like shouldn't the shouldn't the security Council be every country that has nuclear weapons doesn't that make more sense in that case. Okay. Fine keep the England on but then you bring on Pakistan India and North Korea I guess Israel too then no yeah from what I understand Gaelic is really only still spoken in like the Dingle peninsula in Southwestern Ireland. Like like a like. A village full of guys are still chopping it up in Gaelic and it's very funny because all the street signs are in both English and Gaelic and it's it's like a official language of EU and they teach it in schools. But it's like once that once that Band-Aid gets ripped off the sticky the sticky falls off you can't get it back on sorry I know I know you want to reclaim it so that you know you have some distance from your colonizers. But it's just you guys are too good. You guys took to the English language too well. You guys you got to say that the Irish one forced into speaking. English did a really good job and finally we were talking about them earlier.

[46:19](https://youtu.be/gntv5lXUNyk?t=46m19s)

But this is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia our partner our biggest partner in the Middle East. More important I'd say than Israel in many ways but now very interestingly starting to break off starting to recognize that the American project at this point is now at odds with the greater flourishing of world capitalism like and that is honestly something that I find funny about the multi-polar multiple polarity people because people like they really have this article of faith that multi-polarity means that socialism is going to be allowed to like emerge in these countries. But multipolarity is the end Drive of capitalism. It does not want ultimately to be headquartered in any one nation state. It wants to dissolve all of these things it can't do it yet. But that's certainly the drive and the American state project of trying to prevent this from happening which really was initiated with 9 11.

We were kind of floating there after the um after the end of the Cold War and then you know you had the clintonian. You know right to protect Global Watchman fantasy but that was just unsustainable the only thing that's going to prevent the fight. The eventual dethroning of the United States from the as headquarters of global capitalism is a assertion of American military power not diplomatic power because or economic power because economic power is going to keep moving away de-centering from the United States and the war on terror is this last throw of the dice similar to what Putin is doing in Ukraine to secure themselves secure America's position relative to globalizing Capital and that means that our clients are going to start over time having interests that become into greater and greater conflict with the American America's interests and that's what's happening with Saudi Arabia and so now they're starting to smooch the Chinese so yeah multi-polarity.

The great Satan dethroned good in many ways you know but not something that's necessarily going to lead to an efflorescence of socialism. The real question is whether the the declining powers that still have the ability to launch a nuke like Russia and like the United States are going to be able to be restrained from trying to hold on to their preeminence by any means necessary. That's the big question I would like to do Hearts of Iron. So I'm doing I'm currently doing research for a series on the Spanish Civil War that I'll do later this year and it'll be more like enumerated past than hell on Earth. It's just going to be me. Chris is still recuperating because he did way more work on Hell on Earth than I did but it will be scripted and not just off of the Dome. So it would be cool to do when that comes out heart of iron and try to maybe save the Republic save the Spanish Republic.

But man I gotta say that one was really they were pretty cooked. You want to talk an over determined outcome very hard to imagine other than maybe. If a the World War II had started in Europe earlier which is by the end of the war really was the only hope the Republic had and they were kind of banking on it. They were sort of hoping that europe-wide war would break out and that would lead the that would force the democracies to Ally with them against the fascist axis. But in reality they kind of they were always going to be let out to dry because it was in the interest of the intervening countries. The USSR and Germany to and Italy to sort of drag it out and not risk a confrontation in Spain.

 and the Western democracies were hell-bent on just trying to ignore it and and placate the axis as much as possible to avoid having to Ally with the Soviet Union which they in England specifically really really did not want to do. It's very funny. Neoconservatives loved talking about Neville Chamberlain and condemning the appeasement at Munich and the awful cowardliness of the British to fail to stand up to Hitler. But the reason they didn't do that one of the significant reasons they didn't is not because they were Lily liver or any of that. It's because to do so would have necessitated an alliance with the Soviets that they did not want to do the French right by that time of the invasion was saying better Hitler than bloom or better Hitler than Stalin and that was certainly the the the opinion at Whitehall. So like what does that tell you you kneel conservatives whose entire politics is wound up in this anti-communism. But they also had uncertain assumptions that there was a a point at which Hitler would take yes for an answer and he really did break all of the understood rules at that point in a way that they were not They're not ready for but before that he really before Hitler felt ready. He really didn't want to go to war and he certainly didn't want to go to war over Spain and so they were happy to just sort of let it play out and that was going to inevitably lead to the decline of the Republic so yeah.

[53:07](https://youtu.be/gntv5lXUNyk?t=53m07s)

I'll see maybe I don't know when does heart of Iron. Heart of iron start because if you're gonna beat if you're going to win the Spanish Civil War as the Republic. What you need to do is act. First you need to act first which as I've been saying is what liberal Democrats can never do in crisis. Liberal Democrats are incapable of acting first and the working class in Spain was too divided against itself between anarchists and socialist. Wings to act first and the anarchists were too allergic to the institutions that could have allowed them to actually plan a action other than provocation and so everyone was just waiting for someone to do something and that was always going to be the Army and then that's who it was you can do it. Vicky too confed players do and put all your armies and armies and industries in Republican Spanish areas. The funny thing is is that when the rising failed and the the country was divided into two sections all of the industry was in the Republican section. The Nationalist basically got agricultural territory. They got very few of the bigger cities in the country and very little of the ex. The to the degree that there was any industrial base in Spain at that point which was very little was not there. It didn't matter once once non-intervention had the fiction of non-intervention had been agreed upon by the by the Ally by the Bourgeois democracies.

Then it was just going to be a matter of time before but before German and Italian Aid was going to tip the scales which it did very early. They couldn't have gotten the army of Africa across the Strait of Gibraltar without the aid of a German airplanes but the thing about the anarchists. The old cntfai is that it's leaders such as existed and its organs of power were reflecting a simple reality which is that the they represented people who did not want to go through the sphincter of modernity making they didn't want to be socialized into a proletarian subjectivity and they and because of the relative lack of development in Spain. Up. Until that point there were enough of them who were able to access things like mass media newspapers. Literacy guns that they could actually make a stand on those terms and say no rather than accept modern class subjectivity and then move through it. The way that the marxist-oriented parties of the in the rest of Europe were able to do and I think really more than anything. That is the damn nation of anarchism is that it cannot be a political actor and if you cannot set the term of events set the context you maybe can win. But you are most of the time gonna lose but in in Spain it could be.

No. It could have been no other way because how do you convince some arrogates Farm worker you know who's who who works half. Maybe like two times a year and is that the total prostration of some landlord or or someone who has to move to Catalonia to work in the textile industry and and only experiences. Modernity is this wrenching away and as this in miseration and and degradation. How do you how do you get them to be like no trust me dude. It gets better.

I honestly feel like both the anarchists and the Communists got owned in the Spanish Civil War and it really doesn't make sense for either side to point at it as an example of why they were right about anything because yes obviously the anarchists were unable to defend their own Revolution. That's an indictment but once the Communists got what they wanted which is Central authority of the military and a a militarized command and a controlled and domesticated like revolutionary process. In the cities they got. Their asses kicked they they tried to. They tried to fight like a like a conventional military and they had a bunch of set-piece offensives all of which went the exact same way. They gained some ground but they couldn't push any farther because they didn't have enough trucks and then they would wait around for the counter-attack that would inevitably drive them back even further than their original position and destroy a bunch of men and material in the process. I mean there was no there was no winning hand there because what you didn't have was what you had at the Soviet Union which was massive concentrations of workers in the the few major urban areas.

You had a light level of industrialization that was concentrated largely in Catalonia and The Basque country. All the most advanced industry was in the North in places that were dominated politically by bass nationalism and not by socialism and of course. You didn't have a linen the closest thing. They had was the guy that they tried to call the Spanish living Largo Caballero. But he proved himself completely incapable of seizing the moment because there was no moment to seize the the tendrils like when Lenin showed up at the Finland station and reached his hand out to grab at the the sinews of the Bolshevik party. They extended outward into hugely in powerful armed concentrations of soldiers Sailors and workers in huge industrial factories that abutted teeming working-class neighborhoods. But I do think it's interesting that who I say the Army acted first to bring everything back around to the beginning just as we hit an hour but it wasn't really the army writ large. It wasn't everybody in the Army. Obviously the the the the enlisted men and the conscripts and like legionnaires and stuff. They did mostly what they were told one way or the other depending they they acted depending on where they ended up and the top levels. They aren't. The generals not that many of them were involved in the planning of the of the Rising and a minority of them declared for the nationalists. It was who the middle strata it was the majors and the colonels and the captains.

That's the that is in capitalism in any capitalist structure that is where agency rests. The ability of the Socialists to act. First was the result of this unique circumstances of of Russia in crisis and and specifically of the front collapsing and the big cities of Russia being filled with demobilized but still armed former peasant soldiers who could be yoked to a disciplined Central party organization. But of course. It was also the the urban middle class that formed the backbone of the Republic which means that they were the most impotent of every group held hostage to events forced to Very quickly. Give over control of the of the war effort and the state increasingly to the Communists just because they were organized and knew what the they wanted okay. There we go Don't Fear the Reaper I guess is all I can say because all our time has come bye.
