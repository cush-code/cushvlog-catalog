Lonely feeling deep inside find a corner where I can't hide solid footsteps crowding me sudden darkness. But I can't see no sugar tonight or coffee no sugar tonight or cream no sugar to stand beside me no sugar to run with me. No no no in the silence of her mind quiet movements where I can find grabbing for me. Her eyes now I'm falling from the sky. That's no sugar tonight all coffee no sugar tonight or cream no sugar to stand beside me no sugar to run with me johnny meme. There we go everybody have you heard if you're in the game. Then the stroke's the word.

I love how many songs have been written that are basically about how show business is fake. A lot of people become stars and they're like you know what. I think a lot of these. I think a lot of these show folk out here and holly weird. They actually They don't they don't say what they mean all the time and sometimes they they tell you what that you want. They want you to hear so that they can pick your pocket. I mean what's going on they'll turn into jimmy stewart as soon as they get to hollywood well. What's going on around here are signed a record contract and they're trying to screw me so yeah sorry huckleberry. What did you think this was and then they just have to write a song about it to let everybody know and then what do you know. Everybody just keeps going and keeps trying to go in the the dream factory and nobody is dissuaded no matter how many of these songs get written or how many of these movies get made because what is there else to seek people want to know why oh all the kids want to be youtubers. They want to be content creators and why everybody always wants to be an athlete or a rapper instead of it's because in the absence of any project in the absence of any belief in a social order.

Any belief that your efforts put towards it are going to be either is are going to be appreciated or utilized to any greater benefit to anyone if you if if the world is just cynical transactions then what the should you try to do with your life other than be the center of attention to reify that identity that that that singular consciousness that is the entirety of the universe because here's the thing if you make a world where everybody is god and then most of them just have to be regular. People and do shitty jobs. They're gonna get annoyed with that they're gonna get in fact their brains are basically gonna eventually explode from the cognitive dissonance of being god and yet being powerless so of course. Everyone's gonna seek a employment where they can be unalienated which is as close to post-capitalist as you can imagine which is the idea of life as god now. A little bit of alienation can be accepted if you think you're building something beyond yourself. But if a society builds a if you are brought into a a structured reality that says no the only pursuit is selfishness. The only point of view is your own. The only reality is your body well. Then you're going to operate from those premises and that means you're not going to put any effort into anything that isn't immediately validating and that means of course you want money and of course you want to have time buyers for yourself and not according to a boss but more than anything you need to be noticed.

You need to be seen you need to be famous. You have to be famous or else. How are you the sole consciousness in the galaxy that that gap is too great your. Brain can't handle the cognitive dissonance of living as one of many whenever when everything you've encountered culturally tells you that you're the only in my lazy cowardly way of just yearning for it and then complaining about it long enough that a technology came along to allow you the opportunity to get known for complaining that's why everybody wants to be a critic because if there is no energy to produce art because you have no faith in the project of society. Then what you want is the fame without the risk which is criticizing other stuff. Politically artistically. The critic is the default model if you can't be if you can't if you aren't talented enough to do it effortlessly. Like you're a great you're very attractive and that means you can become famous. Just you know by acting or something or you are an actor with a charisma which is another thing that is relatively effortless. Even if it requires you know application but it's application towards a singular goal of say fame. Those people get famous and if you have athletic ability those people get famous but if you're not if you don't have those things if all you have is this ego and this disempowered position as just one of the flossom.

The consumer blobs who make up america then you're gonna get annoyed with it and you're going to complain and along camera technology to allow your complaints to be turned into content and then you've created an entire. Consciousness that exists but it's all a flight away from effort because of it. It is a lot a lack of belief and the thing about the belief is the belief doesn't go away like obviously modernity is this huge hundreds of year arc of disenchantment with the world right like the world losing its magic. The the life become like that is which is unquantifiable is where mystery and and religion and spirit live and what the quantifiable has overt has consumed the world. But that doesn't mean that belief goes away because at the end of the day you have to believe enough to keep your blood pumping in your body and the thing that you believe in if you can't believe it. Anything outside of the body is the body itself and the mind and identity that pilot and so we believe more than ever we believe as much as any people in history have ever believed but we only believe in ourselves and not in the I believe in myself way as in the ourselves our fantasy social fiction that we have turned into reality because remember. This self is not real.

Any more than our social bonds are real any more than any ideological construction out of the the the explosive random matter that we encounter every day is real but we act as though it were. It used to be one thing of many that we believed in. Now all of that belief is concentrated into the self and all we're seeing. The the s a species suicide is due to the fact that we only believe in ourselves which means we can only pursue the most narrow short-term carnal self-interest and that means that means that we can only operate through capitalism. We can only operate through market relationships and that in a context of finite resources that will spell the death of the planet. Now that's not black pill. That's not the end of the world because beliefs change but humans have to believe to live but what they believe in changes we believe in changes. Yes like this is a perfect example. It's not like believing in the self is evil and must be extinguished. It's inevitable it just it used to be a smaller part of our conception of reality self-interest as somebody put a good post. Here self-interest makes class politics relevant exactly exactly The emergence of the liberal self is what allows class consciousness to come into being like peasants would rebel cyclically but never along any kind for the most part not in a coherent like understanding of the politics and as a group it was a spasm against like their most immediate oppressor. They were usually doing their violence on behalf of the king in their own minds. Anyway the kind of like strategically um. This is strategically powerful and and threatening and formidable class politics that is oriented against capital as it is is. Only allow is only possible with the individuated self valuing their alienation enough to stand up for themselves for themselves for their idea of themselves as having inherent value and if their time and having inherent value their time on earth their time. Having consciousness that time has value they want to assert it. But you have to feel it as a separation. You have to feel alienation as a loss. So it's an it's inherent and then necessary.

But we lost the war is the thing the socialist spirit was awakened at the dawn of capitalism and marx was right there to see it coming into fruition but that fight was lost that fight was lost. I would say in the years eight 1914 to 1922. I would say that and that everything then that since then has been a holding action um and that we have reached a period of of of capitalist of complete capitalist domination. The end of history as fukuyama discussed and why he really was right but the thing is there something comes after the end of history because we're in a system that cannot sustain it. Contradictions between the material conditions and the fantasies in the heads of our self deluded capitalist rulers will break it down and we will still be here. Someone makes a very good point. Here that historically capitalism is obsolete and this is what maxes people up a lot of the times because we are far past. The point when capitalism has has ceased to fulfill his historic purpose because remember marx was not did not hate capitalism. The the whole big. The first third of the communist manifesto is a payon to capitalism's progressive features. Capitalism in marxism has a historic role. I think what you would call late capitalism what you would call the whatever this neoliberal. Like techno feudal whatever the hell you want to call it. The post 1918 1989 world is really capitalism having um gone beyond its historic role.

It's still holding on because of its the belief in it its ability to create a a self-sustaining magnetic like electromagnetically charged cultural hegemony like we have created people who cannot live together who cannot cooperate. We've created people who are incapable of doing it under the conditions that they emerge. The isolated socially atomized conditions with a global supply chain that keeps the most horrifying exploitation of the system as far as humanly possible geographically and culturally from the center of consumption and what and that means that even though we have by far the tech the capitalist accumulation necessary to equalize the pain of being alive and not fully but in a vastly mostly more than we are and in a way that could preserve the biosphere.

But the people who could do that are not us. Now that doesn't mean they won't be us at some point but it means right. Now they're not us and getting there getting to those people is everyone's task and if that fails if humanity fails then you will see capitalism just following along as to its technological extinction and who knows how long that will take but it will occur and that is those are all open variables. So I can't say it mostly comes down to how much technology emerges that can sustain it. And of course there is the zardoz option that the rich are able to put technology between themselves and exploitation because that's what it is you're putting technology allows you to put distance between exploitation and the consumption of the pro product of exploitation between the extraction of surplus value and the enjoyment of surface value.

That's what technology allows you couldn't get to a point if the technology happens and this is all who knows. I'm not a tech person that allows them to allows the rich to seal themselves off as in create in a bubble the post the totally automated reality sealing themselves in and then you have ironically enough as peter freys puts up points out in his book. For futures. You have fully luxurated space communism congratulations. You've got it but you've got it without those people being transformed by the process of building it which means they're still demon monads who will destroy themselves as happens in zardoz which is a great great movie. I highly recommend the only people who can survive the frank lee the boredom the boredom. The only people who could survive the boredom of fully luxuriated space communists communism would be people who had a decentered themselves not removed.

Their sense of self not become a behind mind but reduce their sense of self and to put it into a social project because even in this how is it that in the center of america and the center of this system of exploitation where all of the people are living basically post-scarcity lives like to live in the the middle quartile especially if you have one of these jobs and media or around media i.e. The people who are actually doing all the content that people interact with that shapes. Their understanding of what political culture is they're miserable even though they live post-scarcity lives for the most part yes. They're a little exploitated exploited but they know there's some of the few people left on earth who know that their effort will be rewarded who knows that trying will get them something so of course. So these are essentially post-capitalist subjects in their lives and they're miserable and they build an insanity of a political insane asylum to wage war in how the hell do you think they're gonna operate where the reality is hi welcome to life.

You're not gonna have to struggle for anything for your basic existence. You're not gonna have to struggle to keep yourself sustained as a person but you are going to die. you're going to go through life having experiences accumulating a sense of self until it's really the only frame of reference for the world around you and then at some point. It's going to stop good luck have fun like it's the grit. It's the it's. The people neurosis is postmodern neurosis. I think the neuroesthetic of our new victorian like drawing room class.

The yellow wallpaper people which is all of us really if you're listening to this you have the yellow wallpaper disease. A little bit. I know. I do. I mean once again. I'm speaking about myself. If you say weird. We're not miserable. We just want health care. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about people in my position the people who structure this stuff and then how it respond. I'm just saying as an example. These are as close. This is as good as it gets under the system and it results in people building fantasies of anxiety to build give themselves something to worry about like.

The robin deangelo thesis these these comfortable well-off white people who live in the center of an exploitative nightmare system and know that but also are addicted to the pleasure of it resolving that and it is by giving themselves a neurotic fixation on um on their level of racism and that is like if you want to talk about like the hysteria of wokeness on white people. That's what it is. It is this need to self to self absolve. It is the neo puritan need to be dissolved of the guilt of living as you do because you know it's bad but there's nothing else to do and the thing is. I don't there is nothing else for you to do in the sense that you can work towards. You know the betterment of the world but you're probably still going to be at the center of empire. You're probably still going to be exploiting people somewhere but you have to live with it and do you live with it by indulging in a fantasy or do you live with it by facing the reality around you and the answer to that question comes down to how much are you trying to reinforce yourself how much are you trying to get pleasure out of this and that's the thing about. The neurosis of of this is that it gives you pleasure you don't have to sacrifice all that pain you're feeling all that misery.

 the thing about freaking out about oh no one's wearing masks oh my god. What if how long they're telling me. I don't have to wear a mask. But I want to keep wearing a mask. All of that is pleasure at a sense. It is a game you're playing with yourself instead of thinking about the reality that you're a cut off consciousness floating through space. That is in a system lubricated by other people's blood. So that is why this is. This is a process. This is a process of creating a species that is aware of itself as in has detached some percentage of its belief away from in itself into others into that oh yeah. There is stuff outside of there. That's real that's real as as real as I am and that's what makes people struggle sacrifice that's what makes work unalienating and there has to be work.

We got to work but that is unalienated labor and unalienated labor. Build a goddamn could build a dyson spear make america live forever or make america live forever make make humanity extend itself into this cosmos because we have so much technology holy. Steam-powered looms like a machine that would like oh oh yeah it goes like this and it powers a a sewing machine. We have the ability to centrally plan a world sized economy through simula simulations within mach. Within computers. We can map the world in a way to allow all of our automated technology to extend across it. But that's that would be if we believed in something different the tools we have are sufficient if the people were different and it's us and the process. This is history is us grinding those two things against each other because they can't just shift spontaneously. That is the fantasy. I think of a lot not all but a lot of anarchists is a spontaneous phase shift where you can go from being a full. I'm a full individual vigi vigil and I believe in with everything being good for other people but mostly out of a understanding of like utilitarian ethics. You know. I understand that what is good for the many is good for me too. I can go from that person to a state of post-capitalist. post-scarcity can't do that you have to work you have to change and that change has to change others and then the next generation of people have to change too. It's just it is labor and is slow boring of hard boards oh yeah.

That's yes of course. That's that's what politics is. It's also what revolution is by definition unless you want to skip steps which everybody wants to do and I totally get it but here's the thing wanting to skip steps is wanting to feed. The ego wanting to skip. Steps is wanting to keep doing what you're doing already because it feels good and even the stuff that feels bad feels good because it contrasts with the other stuff and it gives you something to chase after it gives you a hedonic treadmill to run the stuff that makes you see the world as it is. That is the desire to actually see things better and actually change things unshorn of pleasure and of course like this doesn't point in any direction. This is all because I'm just trying to say that that there has to be of the most advanced people like there are progressive and and reactionary forces within any polity even in the center of the decadent world capitalist empire that's consuming the. I realize that whatever what do we got here but there is politics here and it has to 

People have people are. It's made by people talking to each other right now because there aren't any structures to join. There isn't any real sys. There is no left to join. There are organizations you can join as an individual but there is no self-conscious left. To join in this country. It has to be built and so people are right. Now. All of us are faced with a choice of what do we do every day to try to make that happen and all I c and I'm trying to ask myself questions well. What can I do well. I'm totally isolated. I'm completely cut off. I am not a worker. I am not in the working class. I am part of that remaining section of of art artisans but also even there I am enmeshed in capitalism as much as any other pmc. So. I could sever all of those chords immediately and try to fight for the working class. How could I do that what could I do in that capacity as a middle-aged limping man with no actual skills or abilities. I could try something but it's a big leap well what do.

I actually what where am i. I'm in this position. There's there's these people who here listen to what. I'm saying if I'm going to keep doing that for now because I honestly don't know what else to do in the middle of this. This pandemic that has now even further cellularized me. I can try to make sense of what to say transparentize the question and and realize that okay if everybody's seeking this if I can assume everyone has good faith is trying to seek betterment. Then all I could do is tell them not what to do because I'm not in a position but how to go about doing it because I'm not in a position to tell anybody what to do. I don't have an idea. I'm. I have no connections in the working class. I have no connection to any movements. I have an idea of how you can approach.

These questions um but that's it and of course that allows me to stay here and cushy in my home and that's the other thing is that you have this fire in your stomach. This combination of like the the ache of of distance from you know the sacred and then also that knowledge that it exists and you've got those and that I think is what causes us to feel to feel things and to be able to build a world around the feelings because we have to translate feelings through that tunnel into conscious ideas and that means being present for the feelings in order to be nearest to that that moment instead of allowing it all to get alienated by us thinking all the time which I know I am very very guilty of doing because what happens is is that even if you have this feeling if you can't stoke it socially if you're not stoking it through actions. You are only thinking about it. You are only in the moment abstracting away an a sort of a logical cage a a syntactic structure that can contain that idea but that can only be made up of the stuff you've ever experienced.

It's. It's it is consumed it is constructed of the experience of the world around you which means it's locked up in the idea of the self. The idea of of of the singularity of your consciousness like you're still in that body you're still in that mind that has those traumas and associations built into it and so as you try to keep this. I this feeling and you keep trying to keep it alive through thought. The thought continues to drift farther and farther away from the feeling because you are fallen from it in time literally in time you're trying to remember something and the longer you try to remember something. The more you have to sort of. improvise to keep it going and to justify why you're not feeling because the only way to keep those feelings in turn them into thoughts and to practice practice which I now understand how that's a useful term because you really can't disengage the two because you're really only thinking until you get to an act and then you do the act and the act gets you like informs your thinking again. You you you the one by themselves just turns into self-interest. Over time it just turns into self-interest. All the time what keeps it alive is.

 . Cooperation is interaction with others socially is a social lived experience and the problem is is that for it to work to be effective. You have to be interacting with people who share your mental construction who have the same associations you have between words and feelings and that's tough that's very difficult and so people go online to try to find people like that but we're not interacting with ourselves as real and body people. We're operating as just pure ego projections of that person shorn from any real feeling and so we just fight and build castles in the sky and and wage what mind combat on each other. Meanwhile our bodies are just sitting there. Our bodies are just sitting in time feeling nothing and so we come back into our bodies not fortified for the fight but reified in in this in the hopelessness and pointlessness of fighting because what's the use and also I'm internet.

It is dualistic in the sense that there is a dual. There isn't that the dialectic is made of of opposites and the un re there have to there has to be at base and irresolvable opposite and it's between space and time that is the one opposite within the the pluralistic universe. That is one that is one thing. There is still space and time and everything else the creation of the universe the bringing into consciousness of human or bringing into existence of life to bring into consciousness of humanity. These are all and then human history and the development of human civilization are all powered by that contradiction. Space and time are the same thing of course but there's still a contradiction between them. Heisenberg like something happens to me.

I have a feeling something touches me and then I feel the touch that doesn't happen simultaneously. It happens afterwards my my body dies before my mind dies which is really what all of this is about the knowledge. We have that our bodies die before our minds do that means that we have to know at some level at some instinctive level. What to do when the moment comes all right we might get a dmt hit exactly but what is that hit gonna be. It's you're not gonna get to choose it. You're not gonna get the. put it up on the jukebox. It's gonna be powered by your deepest below conscious constructions where you did not where you have only been after those were formed trying to make sense of them in your conscious mind so yeah. I hope that made sense somewhat. I know it got a little wacky there. At the end all the quantum stuff. I try not to talk about it because I don't get. I don't understand it.

I feel like I get it enough where it's just like you know you got like a you have a reality tunnel that's made out of different pieces and they're different sizes and some are very granular. Some concepts you got a bunch you can just go over there and you can feel it and you just you feel very confident in it and there's other stuff that's that's solid but still pretty thin or pretty. pretty big you know it's pretty smooth. Not a lot of grit and for me all that is is very smooth. But at the same time I know. I'm not gonna get it any more than I do so once again. I'm going to do a leap of faith that yeah broadly. I know what's going on there and then it and the thing is it makes sense with everything else. It's just putting together a mosaic tablet and then if you can get one that aligns your heart in your head and you can live. It live it with other people that reinforce it both for you and for them you create a reality.

Here's a good one. Why can't. Japan have such a cool spiritual and philosophical history and also such a bloody and imperialist material history. Because we have been running through every existing. Civilization has been one marked by class domination. All cultures. All societies are first and foremost structures of class power.

All religious traditions and spiritualities exist within them. The ideas of those have residences that operate in different ways and under different contexts. So even though the the the earliest strains of things like buddhism and hinduism and christianity we're all expressions of people coming to not to an understanding of reality but to an ability to translate an untranslatable experience into something. Other people could grasp in their mind imaginatively to put a reality into someone's mind. It's essentially magic and it that and language is is a incantation and so you have those magic moments that are defined. What are they defined by place and time people in a specific space experiencing something at the same time and having those experiences fused into language and symbols and then carrying those symbols outward. Some of the people encountering those symbols are going to have a similar experience. Others are going to have an experience from the outside of it that finds it useful and power will take any structure and symbol and turn it towards its use because it can because it has power it's going to take anything because it can now there'll be a resistance. But if it's powerful enough it will keep it and if it's not powerful enough whatever emerges from it well because class has not been conquered will reinscribe class domination and use the stuff for their own method for their own benefit. So our task is not to accept or reject religious traditions in in their cultural like their their their denuded cultural context. You need to ask yourself what religious symbology. What religious concepts what spiritual premises whatever actually make you feel something actually resonate and then you could build from there but yeah from everything has been tainted. Everything is is a instrument of domination. Everything is a tool of hegemony. I mean my god like on their own terms forget what forget their mystification on their own terms.

The guys who settled of the united states and wanted to turn it into the city. On the hill. You brought them you snapped your fingers and brought them to this and say here's it is. They would they would go insane the vulgarness. The the monstrous fallen disgusting materialist filth of it would drive them insane and a lot of right wingers like to say that they like to complain oh. The our early americans would be disgusted but here's the thing they made.

This happen because their conceptions were never defeated. They were the leading they were the top proposition that they were their concept their their their de-spiritualized christianity. Their materialist christianity made this world because they won they fought other things and in the fighting created new things and created synthesis out of other things but they were never unseated from the horse and what do we have for it even on their own terms. It's hell because that's what you'll create you'll create your own hell trying to build a world out of exploitation out of class domination which is committing violence. It is violence to someone that you have to in your heart detach yourself from in a way that kills your own spirit and being in that position of exploitation causes you for very obvious and understandable reasons to detach yourself from the people dominating you and hurts your spirit and then you fight over the scraps. For the next 300 years. No matter what language of religiosity and spirituality you use you're just building that the structures that allow you to do that because these guys one of the the the founding federation the founding generation would be horrified why they won.

This we still have the stupid constitution they're dumb instruction manual is still in power and what can they say oh you distorted it. Oh you you stopped paying attention to it. I'm sorry how was that allowed to happen power was exercised through its structures and dominated. It's a instrument of power what are you complaining about and what's this the people who the whole the real point of this thing as madison others said plainly had nothing to do with creating a civic anything. It was keeping the rich people rich so that they could maintain their position of authority and it worked. The rich have never been been close to being divorced from american power and now we have this world. If if your rule led you to this of what use was the rule because all anything that you're trying to build you you will convince yourself no matter how evil the system you you support is is that some part of it corresponds to a value somewhere and that's yours this.

The cultural superstructure exists to lie to you. It is generated by the ruling class to tell the ruling class that up is down. Down is up and that exploitation is love. Now. They're convincing themselves of this because of their deep selfishness but at a conscious level they believe a lot of it at least some of them do. I would say that like with anyone it is a bell curve. Most do to some extent. Some do completely some do not at all like reinhardt hydric types but most people believe to some degree that they're trying to build a better world or the best possible world and their power allows them to create a system where everyone around them thinks the same thing and that's where we are now and where we've always been revolution is the attempt from below for to organize a counter hegemony with with values that organize around the reality the consonants of human of human dignity. The the equality of the spirit and creating a culture where where everyone else agree believes that and reinforces it to you and then through superior numbers overcoming the powerful.

That's what support that's what was supposed to happen. The hinge point in history was in the early 20th century when you had gotten finally industrial capitalism had had overheated in europe where it was born it. It had fallen follow the script of marx to doom but what's this colonialism. What's this the existence of the united states of america as a place where capitalism's headquarters its brainstem could decamp after world war ii where it had synthesized. It had the united states well. The united well europe was overheating with cot with capitalism.

The steam vent of conflict went to america where the mount the bounty of our land allowed us to resolve away. All a lot of the social conflict at the heart of the european capitalism within the white race by dominating other races and then that meant that in europe the explosion happened right around when you could have predicted it but even though the fight was significant and and there was a big long holding action at the end you know even though the like the battle you want to look back and say like the class war. in the class war yeah in the class war. Gettysburg and vicksburg are like world war one and the failure of the german revolution but then you've got you know the soviet union. In there you got the chinese. Then you have the anti-colonial movements of the third world and then the labor movement in the first and they hold off for a while and then that's that's lee retreating into northern virginia and then of course. 1989 is appomattox but now the the contradictions the material contradictions continue so we're going to still see possibilities emerge erupt and change but like the the the the the the thing that saved capitalism was. Space was space and resources that could be technologically dominated to to alleviate away from the centers of power.

The exploitation of those closest to it i.e the working classes of the working class of europe and the the racially white working class of the united states. Although sections of other minority groups too just in in you know in in a in a segregated fashion and yeah we got like oh yeah cuba god bless cuba but cuba's like you know they're They're the holdouts in the jungle and they should stay there there. But that doesn't mean that they can challenge capitalism why was japan able to westernize and become an imperial power despite happening because it was isolated because it was by itself because it was not It was able to end and its feudal era. I don't know that much about japan but its fuel era was marked by such intense essentially what you had in europe in. Japan was the same thing you had in europe which is a lot a growing population in a relatively constrained geographic area of course. This is on a smaller scale which fighting over resources which means state formation and state capacity being built very very effectively bureaucratic the bureaucratic state and the technological state. It is that content this is this is all from scheidel This is this I really do believe that the thing that creates that that created progress the the capitalism and the conditions for capitalism which allowed japan to adopt it as quickly as they did.

 is medium-sized state competition and in japan you had like the shogunate but within it you had just a constant conflict between low-level. rulers you did not have any kind of dominant statewide monopoly on force and that's what you didn't have in europe. Either. There was no monopoly of force of course state competition is one state attempting to dominate another at the expense of the other and now and when you have situations like europe it makes sense and you have japan. It makes sense but then oh what's this we have a world system. Now. We have a totally connected economic structure oh no what what are we competing about now where what is what is the actual competition here oh. I might want to start cooperating might be a good idea but I don't know we'll see.

I don't know latin america if there is hope it's helping latin america that's my in africa. But I don't know as much but definitely latin america where you have you have a legacy of you know. A 20th century left that still has actual social function and cohesion. I mean obviously it's under assault but there does seem to be the capacity for coordinated resistance there and politically expressed resistance and that means it's that's why it's been such a that's where outside of like southeast asia. That is where the most most people were sacrificed to dollar hegemony in the cold. In the in the cold war was was in latin america because of the the the effectiveness and the the resiliency of the resistance and like if if latin america could become in some way like a coherent left block that could then pla like tip the balance between the united states and china and like force some sort of accommodation with china.

It's not. It's not world communism but it's better than the alternative if anyone's read vince bevin's great book the jakarta method he one of the things that's great about. It is that he contextualizes the indonesian genocide in the cold war in a way that I don't think necessarily. Everyone would have done because and I think it comes from the fact that he wrote. He was a journalist in brazil for many years before he went to indonesia is that he pointed out that the jakarta method while it was obviously first you know tried out in. Indonesia was really extended and perfected over the cold war not in the rest of asia but in latin america in chile and in argentina and in operation condor and then you have the fact that the colombian government has basically been an american like the client military.

The colombia somebody just said like column The colombian president or something said somebody says that colombia is the israel of latin america and we're proud of it. Yes exactly even though bolsonaro of course loves and smooches um you know he loves. israel brazil is coming late to the party. Here like colombia has been the military. The extended military footprint of the united states into latin america for generation now mostly under the guise of the drug war but of course that is mostly about arming narco terror gangs who who make sure that union organizers get killed and peasants are continue being dispossessed. Like plan it was called plan columbia you know so and brazil was never really a a flash point of that particular site. You know a fake conduit for american military weapons and training and personnel so yeah. Colombia is the israel of latin america but now you're getting this massive resistance and it's being repressed violently that's terrifying and horrible.

But when you see that this is not an isolated incident that this is a pattern throughout all of the nations of south america for the most part. if there's hope. I think that's where it is but again. I don't know enough about latin american. His latin american politics right now. I don't speak spanish or portuguese to know the specifics but looking at it from a scance from afar. It seems that's where like human the potential for for actual organization that can be effective. exists oh somebody wants to talk about the labor party l o l that's all I gotta say there l o l that's so losing a seat that they've held since the 60s ma whatever I mean they had their chance.

England had their chance and they were they were too miserable to pull it off. They're too they're too far gone and why shouldn't they be. They're the ones who did this to us. Like obviously. We are all we all did this too. But we were born into a world shaped more than in america that by those disgusting. Sheep folds no resources what are you gonna do and they did it. They took over the world they jacked everybody else's. Now all their edible food comes from thousands of miles away but they're miserable about it as I said they're miserable about it. They got all they wanted. They got out on top they got to they got to trade off. They got to sell high on the british empire because they could have lost it all. I mean my god imagine a some sort of third worldest overthrow of of the british empire instead of them getting to just sign it over to the united states and then get to get a nice welfare state. After the war. They're miserable because every short-term deal that you make with the mo with malik kills you in the end because you're being stripped. You're selling your soul you're selling your soul. You're selling it piece by piece until you're born into a soulless world. What like england hey england solas we're basically soulless and it's all about your distance. How long you have been a society fully alienated. So it'll be very interesting just it'll be very interesting to see how I mean obviously. It's not like.

This is going to change the labor party. They they're they want. The blairite scum are ascendant. They're just going to keep bullshitting and blaming corbin so and then they'll they'll get wiped out in the next election and you'll get it another crowd who promises not the same not to make the same mistakes and is gonna be somehow not tainted by it. But they're gonna be the same guys. I don't know anything about somebody's asking about the albanian elections. I don't know anything about it someone's asking. If it's relevant to current moments is what did the hoshi did like enver. Hosa's kid get in or something what happened in. Albania did the um oh yes enverhosia junior one with the more bunkers party.

Why did this a very good question to end on why did the anc go neo-liberal. I would argue for the same reason that michael collins came back to ireland with the treaty because it's the deal they thought they could get and they figured well. If we get political power. We'll be able to turn it into economic power but it turns out no the moment for that was gone historically. I don't think it's any coincidence that you see the end of apartheid after the fall of communism with the soviets out of the picture. It's a different question about whether you hand over political power to blacks because as long as the the economic heights have been held by whites on behalf of capital let the let him let him go let him do it if it's what keeps the system going and what maintains the flows. The spice let them have it and knowing that there was no leverage to get beyond a political sub because where would where would their if they had demanded. No we we demand control of the economy. We demand like central bank authority and all that stuff how much of that western support that they got for their boycott and sanctions and would still exist. So they got a deal and they got power and it helped it helped it materially benefited in some respects and more importantly. It materially benefited some people and that is the problem with that is the inherent issue with with communal politics like that is stripped of a class conflict is that once you get an anc that is that is just another political capitalist political party. It ends up existing to benefit people who are already on inside sort of the the bubble of this.

The the small bourgeois and higher and you just enlarge in the bourgeois and you racially diversify the bourgeois without changing the class structure. All right. I think that'll be that'll be the game for tonight. Hope. It went well hope it made a little bit of sense. What does this gizmo.
