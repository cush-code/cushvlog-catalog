'my father can you hear me you guys see me my out here. God. I feel older than I actually am which I didn't think was possible oh boy oh wait. This looks like it's me hi guys sorry about that I'm here welcome everyone welcome. We've struck a blow against the forces of Zuckerberg today because we have stolen the goose the mighty goose of content eyeball drawing that I've been doing for his His Dark Lord at Instagram which of course is on my facebook. Now. I'm taking my talents to be zoast. Ohm I'm in the bezel stone which means that when the apocalypse comes I will be one of his court jesters on his floating garbage scow island that he will be living on sort of like Jabba's pleasure skiff but the size of Rhode Island and I will be on there I will be dancing and catering for his delight. I see that it is not working. I guess the thing is we have like affiliates on and if we don't make sure they're knocked off. We can't knock them off.

You got to get in the settings. It's about getting in the settings and I don't know anything about settings. I'm just a simple country boy. I'm just a simple country Oregon Trail millennial who encountered him computers as a child in the form of a  cube shaped. Mac Apple 2 and a floppy disk was a like those were things they were floppy. They flopped when he held them so I don't understand this sit. It controls my life and my destiny and it's fused to me in a psychic level like I'm spiritually fused to the machine in a way that will never be removed. I mean like that is the basis of the arts acceleration. Ax stin site is that we are in a situation where we are fusing with technology. Capitalism is basically an algorithm rewriting us towards becoming robots. I talked about this with Liz and brace for true Anna and if we keep being pulled in that direction we will become machines.

We will be stripped of all sent species being and flattened to be mere reproducers or receivers and distributors of stimuli neural pathways basically for the great machine of capitalism that is its goal but the thing is and this is where dialectics come in your. Amp rims would say well. That's why you got to cut off the machine you got to cut off the the tube connecting you but know at this point we are Siamese twins. We are conjoined that there is a vital exchange happening there. It is part of us in a way that is lethal. We cannot sever it without losing all of the progressed like upward progressive civilizational moves. We've done as a species we can't cut off the computer. We've got to though control it. We've got to dominate it and that's how you get your fully automated luxury space from Ashville ISM which the reason I don't like that is because it isn't. It is metaphysically dire. It is as metaphysically nihilistic as the eternal expansionist fantasy of fashion of capitalism that leads to like the idea that you are the one consciousness persisting eternally in the form of a technological singularity that you imagine yourself to be in commando like when those guys imagine the singularity they do not imagine becoming in the some Borg. They imagine being maintain their consciousness and separateness and identity as themselves but to do that you have to. Eventually you will be the only thing left in the universe. Thanks to their of our dynamics and the and the eventual dispersal of all energies.

You will eventually just be one voice in an eternity. It won't be an eternity though it'll be it'll only feel like it'll be like the jaunt. Basically that's Stephen King story at the end of which when you're jabbering a screaming mad beast. Then you will die horribly in in fear as the last energy cycle ends and it starts back up again with the next big bang that comes immediately after that last one of course and then guess what you get to go through that all over again and over all over again and you are doomed to the eternal recurrence that Nietzsche and Alan Moore talked about congratulations you get to relive that you get to relive seven Millennia's millennia millennia as a was just like pea rattling around in a can. The can being whatever like techno fantasy you imagine you're gonna be persisting in that's nihilistic but so is fully all ugh sharee it because that's hell. That's an imagined hell where you think you're going to heaven but twist it's actually how but the other one fully automated luxury space communism that leads to a similar nihilistic sterility. It leads to an idea that you could ever find pleasure. Meaningful sustained I mean I'm sorry meaning you could ever find the meaning to continue the meaning to find worth in yourself to continue living in mere physical pleasure that could be extended indefinitely that would become hell.

Also you need to have as your goal transcendence. There must be a transcendent and that is why those people say we live you need to have religion and in politics is correct because you need to have a transcendent and insight but the thing is that doesn't have to be religious. It literally can you can believe in transcendence with every single belief system that you already have you do not need to rewire yourself to believe in it. You don't need to negotiate through like the violence that happens in pluralistic religious societies or when one like modern cultural religious societies you know like where there's where other religions are illegal and stomped out. It would be because the thing that matters is just the goal and the goal is everyone reducing their attachment to this material world to the degree that they can find communion with the eternal which exists outside the material world. All right. We're getting we're getting esoteric again. I was hoping not to do that I was gonna talk about Joe Biden and then we got all esoteric on you guys. I'm sorry so let's see what guys are talking about.

Now see what you guys are looking at hey guys yeah. We're stuck in eminence until we escape it and we can and once one of us does we all will. That's the beauty of it. We all will but one of us has to do it and the beauty beauty part is one of us did because that's why we know that's why we're here because it goes backwards and forwards. Causality does not go in one direction. Causality goes in every direction simultaneously oh man I'm worrying now. I think I've gone a little over the I'm worried. You guys are gonna freak out. I'm sorry. It's like you can't take together everyone who has had an insight into this greater reality. They have had a peek past the veil basically or come close to the veil or glimpse down to the side of their eye. Past the veil you can get them together and because of their different cultural limitations and intellectual limitations and spiritual limitations which are all the same thing because they're all bound up in what others have done to you and your life because we're all our acts are totally determined and you end up seeing some of the veil. It's gonna be different than everybody else's and then because you're gonna be translating it with a specific personal life. Personal experience that no one else can replicate and you have to find a translation and that translation loses as all transit transitions do as all energy transfers do. It loses power as it is translated and so if it goes as it goes from the brain to the tongue in two words into the ear of someone else who has a totally different life and experiences. It has already been degraded to a degree that you're only getting a bit of it and so everyone's getting different bits and collaboration and cooperation if they're the cornerstone of your social engine or if they're if there's like. The the social engine of your society is cooperation that you will bring those things together to get a greater truth than any one of them would have been able to get or any group of people all revolving around one concept would have ever got. It lets the light through that's why materialism. That's why materialism that's why the dialectical materialism. That's why Marxism is part of that cuz Marx saw a part of it Sidharth of Gautama saw a part of it. Jesus Christ saw a part of it. Marks Eugene V Debs Martin Luther King saw a big chunk and it's binding them together into a into a consciousness that it can encompass the human experience and what is that but God what is that but eternity all right.


I'm gonna chill out. Now. We're gonna get more normal. I'm going to kind of translate those thoughts down to the level of like more practical considerations that other people can relate to better because of their similar language and experiences. So what are you guys talking about what's going on Joe Patton fell asleep today during his thing where Hillary talked to. It wasn't that funny isn't that funny that's so funny he fell asleep and it made me realize how amazingly just tragically powerful. It is that Joe Biden is a man who spent his entire life. I mean remember this is a man who was elected to the Senate at age 29 before he could legally take the office. He turned 30 between the election day and his swearing-in that is an ambition that is like a stellar fire. So this is a man who clearly I guarantee you when he was taking that oath of office as much as he might have been feeling about his dead wife and dead children who had just been in that car accident. He was also thinking that one day he would be president. One day he would be president and that day would come pretty quickly. I mean come on the youngest-ever senator that senate that's like one of the closest rungs to the presidency. There is up there was governor those two really so he had every reason to believe he'd be the youngest president ever and even though he waited a little too long for that to be the case.

He did Ron in 1988 oh wait a minute. No he would have been no yeah he would've been over 40 that's or he would have been older than JFK. So he already but he was still different very young. He had way less hair back then than he does now somehow I don't know how that happened and he had a disastrous a terrible presidential debate race where he was humiliated and his brain blew up. He had two two strokes two brain hemorrhages rather that almost killed him that he went back and the whole time he's doing this. He is operating from the absolute through from from a self motivation that is completely personal ambition.

Like the only thing motivating Joseph Biden's political choices was personal ambition. His a man be sure to be present in the United States and that meant that he saw the powers arrayed in the country and chose policies and causes that would make them like him give him shine enough to beast talked about at their councils of State and their underground bunkers and at their Bohemian Grove child orgies and it worked I mean a guy for a Delaware Senator making a plausible run for president that's impressive and then he became you know it was foreign foreign services chairman so he had a huge role in our foreign policy. All of it bad he was in favor of because the thing is all of his actions from becoming a truck warrior to his hawkish. This Isle of these were determined by what Capitol wanted in the aftermath of the 70s crisis. What Capitol wanted was neoliberalism and what that meant in specifics was things like bankruptcy reform. Things like tough drug sentences things like high military budgets. That is what they wanted and that's what he delivered them and so but and then he ran for president again and this time even though he had put in all the work and he had the resume yeah snuck up under by somebody who the parties social wing had basically pulled into existence and and made him obsolete in a way. But then he was rescued from from pernari by this very man because he had done that he hadn't done the work he had done the work to be president and then social situation had changed that he was no longer a viable president but he still retained cachet within the party within the media that he held a role that needed to be that could be. He became he was still useful to them and so they put him in the VP spot and they rescued him from what would it be.

He'd be Chris Dodd right now if it hadn't been for that and then he he honestly blew it by that running in 2016. But that's because Biden told Obama told him not to and he was suckered into thinking that Obama was his buddy and his son had just died and he was off his game. I bet I mean he was already kind of losing some of the plot but then he sees her lose. In 2016 knows he would have won anyone if that's not. I don't anyone wants to argue. The Joe Biden wouldn't beat Trump. They're wrong you could talk about how Trump is the accumulation of all these realities and how he was inevitable and all that's true but still in this specific situation of 2016. Biden would it be Trump handily and he knows and now he's just consumed as his brain is dying. In his last moments. He is consumed with the thought that he could have had it and so even though he is clearly the energy is draining for the moment. He reaches out to grab it because it's his last chance and even as he's falling he's picked back up by the accumulated decisions of a party that had created these aggregations of voters who responded to x y&z mostly the media who had x y&z a social or personal connections to the plug the Democratic Party as an institution and that saved him. Thus the party saved him again and of course but now if it happens and he becomes president. He's made his the thing he wanted his whole life. He will not know it. He won't know he won't really know he will only have a dim suspicion of what being the president is and it will be in. It will be to him indistinguishable from a nightmare.

Can. You just think about what a Twilight Zone episode that is and this is four years after Hillary Clinton who spent her entire life was the same merciless pursuit of power as Biden had was thwarted by a guy who didn't who wasn't trying to win. It's the irony. It's just. The ironies are just stacking their pancakes which is what makes me think that Biden might win as much as he might look like he can't and that's why I give my eyebrow my peoples eyebrow to anybody who says that they say confidently that Biden's gonna lose. I'm sorry man. I have no idea this shit's in the air. It's in the air folks to sue the air that's exciting. It's gonna be crazy so yeah. There's gonna be a man in the White House who doesn't know he what he's there but once. But once he wants to beast. He's because like I'll he'll have left is that it's like the the shadow of his personality and that will be wanting to be President but he'll be President but he won't be able to register that because all of his near-term memory will be gone so he will be wandering the White House still wishing. He'd been president still regretting never getting there still imagining and torturing himself with thoughts of being president that worked thoughts of warrant fantasies. It's actually him in the White House just think about that he's being he's in the White House but in his mind it's just a tormenting fantasy of what he never accomplished oh Jesus whoa that's heavy.

He is literally. He literally would have made a hell of heaven because of his sinful and wicked decision to forsake meaning and justice and any greater and any greater virtue than personal ambition and guess. What it destroys you. You were destroyed by your ambition even as your half corpse is hoisted to actual power. Your spirit has been dissolved in acid and is no longer there and now I'm thinking. It's like a Tales from the Crypt episode greetings.


Our next Tara. To you there is a tamp cheeto in the White House which is pretty funny. Let's talk demon night great movie Bill Sadler Billy Zane Jada Pinkett before she was Smith I think Dick Miller Thomas Haden Church. Chasey Lane like I said somebody asked about Jessie picture as the greens. I like it. I like the idea of it.

It'll be fun like I said do not devote all your spiritual energy to it. It should be a fun blow off while you're doing real work whatever that means to you. I cannot judge it because everybody's situation is different. The situation is fluid. I am NOT making arguments work act from your heart is all I ask people what to do is up to you then. It's not me that it's not me. I swear to god. That is not me sobbing it off on to someone else. It's me being responsible because I don't trust anybody can have enough confidence in the moment to make big predictions. I think the smaller the situation. The more likely it is that your understanding of it right now. It's correct and so what you think is the right thing to do is what you should do well. You should follow that you should follow your heart. You should follow you're just like trying to push against your fear by following your heart. That's all I ask that's what I'm trying to do but like I'm saying as you're doing that if you want. To blow off some steam and we're all gonna have to blow off scene anniversary of getting off. Twitter or none of us are getting off watching our shows. I'm not sure you're not stopping owning people. It's how you get through the rest of it.

If you didn't do that you couldn't do the other so it's necessary. If you want to make that up anyone make it Jesse Ventura make it Jesse because land you get a decent chunk you could get three. You think he couldn't get three. Nader never got three. I think he could get three didn't Gary Johnson. Get three Gary Johnson got three didn't mean yes. He did yep. I bet that's even sure I could get three at least in fact that should be the over-under. No that's a little high. I wouldn't get I wouldn't take money on that over-under is 2 and a half I would go to take the over. I'll say that do you mean over-under Jesse Ventura at two and a half percent of the vote I will take you over and if it's anything lower than that then that's easy money if it's anything lower. If there if anything lower the two and a half that's easy money at three is when we wonder maybe a little more maybe a little less. But if it's anything less than three you take that bet he could get five. I honestly think he could get five which the greens have never done. I mean it see here's ago somebody says and this is why you need to treat it right. This is why you need perspective. They said it doesn't mean anything unless it's five. It doesn't mean anything no matter what because if there is going to be some political formation that emerges electoral to defeat or to supplant the Democrats from the left. That's not going to matter the Jesse Ventura getting five or six percent of the vote.

It's not going to be make that happen one way or the other it won't make it happen and it will prevent it from happening. Other forces are going to be determinative that that is a specific moment for a specific thing to have are you guys doing oh man. Bernie is the vp. Bernie is VP to a chess even share a ticket ooh. Now you've got me. Now you've got me. You got me on the hook a little bit you're tempting me. This is ooh this is naughty of you because right okay I need to know the specifics of this because one of the big reasons that Bernie could not run third party. If you wanted to in this thing is the sore loser laws I don't know if you guys knows what those are. But the vast majority of states have laws on the books that say if you run for either party's a primary and you don't win. You cannot run in the in the general and you might say that's weird and the answer for that why that happens is because on issues of ballot access the Democratic Party and the Republican Party have identical interests which is maintaining a two-party system maintaining a cartel essentially system like they are essentially a cartel representing capitalist interests. Now they don't want to let anybody else into that space representing other interests and that's why they make it very hard to get off balance and so that's one of the ways that they make it hard to do to like try to attack try to take over a party and then try to supplant it. If you fail. They basically make it impossible either way.

We've saw how they made it impossible for Bernie to take it from inside and ballot access laws make it impossible for him to take him from outside. It's very frustrating. That's why the best the left electoral II has ever been able to do has been to pressure as a democratic party like the populist like the Prairie populist and Brian did in the 1890s like the progressives did in the 20s. Like the Communists kind of like the Socialists did you know that kind of thing at best. That's what you're gonna get so. But I don't know if it's on the law that you can't run as a vice president because she didn't run. Bernie didn't run as vice president. You know does the law do look sore loser laws pertain to the vice president because if they don't that Bernie should be Jesse Ventura's vice president because  that I'll say it right now isn't that the perfect synthesis that we've been talking about somebody with Bernie's track record of being right about everything and it's obvious earnestness and his honest obvious compassion and care for every human being and then the smack-talking don't give a  Jesse Ventura if you're talking those two versus a trump who let everyone what a hundred thousand people died because he didn't want the number to go down and it's like support.

Though every day I think Trump is getting more and more of the blame which means he will be more and more. By the end of this but if it's between him and mum Ravi ever living the guy who fell asleep during his own Town Hall. Today the guy who cannot string a sentence together people make fun of Trump. Yes he told people to inject he said and there's the thing we could put it out to the skin maybe and see it's like yeah that was pretty stupid. What would Biden's version of that been it would have been the bleach you know. There's you put it on and it's thing if you've got it. The back end you know Rehoboth. There's I go the Keith kitchen and there'd be the kitchen and and we come back with hotdogs and bleach that would have been his version of that of that inject bleached under your skin gaff. There's just turn off turnout would collapse and the people who would vote would be the most glassy-eyed partisans of either side which would make it a toss-up that could lead to a literal like crisis of legitimacy. As inevitably I could send electoral vote tie or there are multiple states that have like imagine if there's still if this is still around and we haven't figured out mail-in voting. By no remember there are going to be states that are going to be as  up in there. In there there a general election voting is like la Earth like Illinois and Wisconsin ordering the primary which means there will be no legitimacy to this election. Whatsoever no one will believe any of the numbers that could legitimately happen just holy.


No see I disagree that that was a bad Biden impression. Felix's Biden impression is Biden from a month ago. It's already a different guy. Now he is. He is completely incoherent like. It's not even it's like those senses Chomsky said were impossible because you know that were possible to construct because of our inborn grammar structures. He's it's it's glossolalia.

A glossolalia so keep that in mind thank you so those two against each other yeah. You could actually see a breakdown of legitimacy. You could see you could like people talk about the United States splitting up. That is the situation what because like the reason it won't is is because of the strength of our institutions like they are incredibly durable because of the amount of cultural Buy and they have like we really have propagandized Americans to an incredible extent to the extent that these things carry real meaning like the Constitution. Like we've joked. I've talked about how it's insane that the Joint Chiefs is not basically cooed. Trump. It's it's just blows my mind. It's like you guys know that this is dangerous and horrible and that we could this guy could get us all killed. Instead. They listen to him and when he said don't test people they didn't test people like when he says you know don't give New York masks. They don't do it and that undermines literally the health and security of the nation. Like all the stuff that those idiots think that they're supposed to uphold and they probably even if you probably get him to admit that they do think this is  up but if you said hey shouldn't you stop him they'd be like no he's the president. It's like they'd have. The guardrails are so hard that they haven't even thought that that's about the thing that could break that is that the thing the big mass ritual that legitimizes this entire thing that reifies every four years.

This entire thing is the massive extra-long blood and thunder carnival of the US presidential elections. In fact you could argue that the reason that presidential election seasons are getting longer and longer is because they have to occupy more and more emotional energy of the population so that they can justify more and more immiseration like things are getting worse and worse and democratic and the elections are getting less and less legitimate just because one party is fiddling with the knobs in such a way to depress the the reflection between voting intention and results. So we've already seen two presidential elections where the loser became president because of an archaic and institution that no one can defend legibly. Everyone who makes every justification for the the electoral college is preposterous. On its face it has reason backwards. It is it is and and it is so wildly reason backwards that it's not even worth engaging with so that's already a little legitimacy. Many of gerrymandering and and interventions and the destruction of the Voting Rights Act.

We already have crisis and then on the other side that's how that's how Democrats get alienated from these democratic institutions. Republicans get alienated from these democratic institutions because when they lose they don't have that excuse because there is no reason other than there weren't as popular and they don't want to accept that so oh no it was illegal immigrants cheating it was X Y & Z it was it was dead people like in Chicago and we like point to real historical voting theft and it's like well. I guess you're right about that but like it's all fantasy. But they are just as just as invested in election emotionally in these things being rigged. Elections now that undermines their colluded intimacy. But we need the legitimacy because only by the idea that like these things are coming from an institution that we built and that we rebuild every year and every day by caring about politics and then voting. Those guys are not there for any reason related to my well-being and then it whole thing breaks. Then it snaps in half and and I think that honestly could it could do it. It's it's scary to think about but I really don't know how else you can see something like that happening. If you have a kovat infected electorate or different states have different standards. Some states close almost all of their polling places. Some states do vote by mail. Some states do partial vote by mail or whatever a hodgepodge you could see all of that invested emotional energy that went into propping up.

These things break all of the degree to which you care about who the president is all the degree to which you care about owning the libs with manga if you're a conservative or how much you care about making the damn cheeto in chief get owned by watching The Daily Show for the Democrats all that emotional energy. All that or goats just just evaporating like no longer propping up the system because you don't believe in the outcome you don't believe the investment has been an earnest. It's not legitimate that's why as I was saying things get worse and worse. Every years we get continually immiseration and our votes don't change anything so the vote. The election year has to get longer longer so that your emotional investment in the spectacle becomes more so that your is because because the degree of your emotional investment in the spectacle of the presidential election is exactly the degree of emotional investment. You have in the institutions that it creates like the presidency like the US government like the United States of America so it happened so that's a lot if you're if things are good. That level of investment is very high because things are good and because you know that you can make them better by voting. If that is gone and everything's bad. You have to fill that gap and you fill the gap with spectacle and with the emotional ritual associated with investing the sim of politics with a hollow cultural meaning. So that's why that head-to-head race is terrified but if you throw.

If you throw Jesse and Bernie out there you know and like make everybody clear that like Bernie's is the brain of the operation that like whatever he's said in the past that like the last thirty years have shown Jesse that the answer to a lot of the questions he's always been. Asking is in socialism like think about the power of that because Jesse Ventura is a classic kind of dumb guy who means well like Joe Rogan and the thing about dumb guys that meanwhile the United States is because there's so little coherent leftist explanatory art that anyone can access but certainly a guy like that would want to access their left trying to big sense the world with right-wing agitprop and with frankly a left-wing online culture that is implicitly hostile to a guy who doesn't already come free equipped with the smart guy aka college education collection of social opinions that make you a decent and worthy human being according to bougie well social values as the blues wild liberal values and so there's the sense you're not getting anything from them and getting to yell that by them and the only thing you're seeing is the right you're like okay but light and in that things and you see the way that they bob and weave and you see that the way that like over time. Trump becoming that and the enemy of these same tut-tutting liberal and leftists who scream at them having the same reaction to Trump makes them think well. They a man maybe Trump's on to something imagine if you had a figure like that like. Vencie Ventura who tapped that same energy to become a much better than Trump is president governor of Minnesota and he said I've spent my whole life trying to make America better and and trying to make our lives of greater and I've seen you know. I've expected the documents. I've seen you know I've seen horrible things happen like 9/11 and and I've wondered like who is behind. All this awfulness like what kind of evil hand is the puppeteer making this happen and people have accused me being anti-semitic or for or for being a racist or something or or for being whatever. But I have found over the years that that puppet string or the puppet master has a name and it's capitalism. I now see especially during this Covent crisis. This is being monopolized and monetized and privatized. I see capitalism is the hand behind everything that I have fought against and Bernie has been fighting against it. The whole time come on you don't think that could win a three-way race. I think it good of course that doesn't solve any problems because a Ventura Sanders White House is still doomed to succeed at doing anything it would want to because there's no way they would get any kind of electoral legislative majority. They wouldn't get people in Congress supporting them. They would have to deal with Republicans and Democrats who could unite against them the way that they united against Jesse when he was governor of Minnesota. The question is whether that conflict can be productively used as a mobilization tool which was always the dream of a Bernie Sanders presidency even when he was running within the party can you use the conflict between a powerful but still constrained executive against a powerful but constrained Congress that does not represent your interests who do you support. I mean that's how the Roman Empire fell that's that's basic I'm describing essentially the the conflict between the optimist and the popularise from the gerak eye to Julius Caesar and the quick but the question is can. It's not does this the does the office of the Senate or of the presidency do that it is does. The conflict itself generate a mobilized working class that can take the advantages that it can through the powers that the presidency does possess and leverage them to greater and greater success elsewhere.


So there you go there you go what happens if the internet stops working oh. Boy wow that's a real scary question because what will we do man. I mean I don't think anybody on any side of the spectrum has any plan B for not just communicating but just processing the world without the internet how the hell would you even begin to process the world without the internet right. Now like this is what I mean when I say you can't cut off the technology and survive the way that like the Kaczynski people want because at this point the internet has been fused socially to us in such a way that to have it immediately disrupted like that would be socially fatal which I mean if you want to go Fight Club about it. You say sure that's great but if you think that would be a setback for Humanity in the long run and undiluted oh or at least doesn't help the dialect move at a speed that might be better for the people you know and love. Let's say like maybe it'd be better to grab this technology now and direct it well instead of having to wait another couple of cycles to get there. But clearly it is terrifyingly incorporated into our social beings. See that's the thing it's like technology doesn't make people happy at this point. Technology. Just makes keeps people alive like that's what that's the ideal that's the ideal transaction capitalism.

It's not you want this thing and I give it to you. It's you need this thing and I give it to you like what is fine and it want you after you start after. You get rid of all the one level of needs. That's when you have to start creating wants and wants are great but the ideal want turns into a need. That's why the products that are the bestsellers are the ones that turn into needs like your pornography like your cigarettes and alcohol and the Internet is a need. Is it okay to be a virgin of course weird odd question.

I'm drinking a spindrift. Yes I'd have to say that one thing that I like about twitch now that I've moved from Instagram is it the Instagram videos are limited to an hour so sometimes I'll be getting like my win back and I have to stop I'm still gonna go keep them around an hour. That's gonna be what I'm gonna shoot for unless I get kind of carried away with something but so just to let everybody know you'll still keep the length similar. But I might add some at the end. What is my opinion on twitch culture. It's baffling and terrifying like all youth culture is the theme time I make no bones about the Zoomers frightening me feeling like they are further down the road towards dehumanization. That technology is leading us down. I am like the bearded guy you know what that is a huge compliment thank you. That's one of my foundational texts I've never seen. They live that I was like seven of a PHP or something and they have these this guy that's all beer to do with glasses reading into TV about how they like the aliens are. Here they're trying to raise the temperature so that we can make the place more s pitiable to their race. That's uh. That's that's and I remember thinking. That's a cool guy to be ok this guy's a Pam Peep Fox and now Here I am all you guys got any questions. I told you guys.

Somebody said what happens to North Korea long term long term. The joushi ideal becomes the pervading ideology of the galaxy and then that it becomes the basis many many years later. After many breakdowns and reformations becomes the basis for your fully auxiliaries and luxury space communism which then after many more breakdowns and collapses and then rebuild ease becomes the basis for the transcendence collective moment of realization. I can't really I don't really understand you Shay. It's it's the special sauce kind of it's basically somebody took Stalinism that they inherited from the Russians who put them in power. After World War two ended the Kim's and they threw in some like dynastic and national like racial. Basically they adapted Stalinist Marxist Leninist state that pervaded in a lot of places after the cold war from Ethiopia to Albania and they then added to it add mixtures over the years as it persisted and after it was you know tested by the massive trauma of World War of the Korean War which is like you want to talk about why North Korea is messed up a good answer is the trauma it endured when it was a baby basically like we kicked that we punted the  mud hole in it and that and its status as a pariah state and it's very close-knit monarchical like leadership structure like maintaining stability by just instituting monarchy which you know if you have a stable enough. Political class. Monarchy is the way to go like if your political classes stabilize monarchy is ideal because it provides sort of a neutral arbiter because it kind of draws from everyone equally. It's only when you have a situation where monarchs are perceived to favor of factions that monarchy is undermined and that's why monarchy does so well in those like hegemonic social democracies in Scandinavia and also does well in really a really powerful totalitarian state so anyway.

So then they put those things together and gee Shay is like. It's basically aunt Arkell Marxist Leninist which I think raises like the status of soldiers to like worker like or like I think something to do with make like sort of raising soldiers like a category like up of working-class or something like that. I'm not a hundred percent certain. I'm not an expert but yeah. It's it's. It's a gumbo. It's an ideological stew made up of the post-war experience of North Korea which is true of all ideologies. Where is just like Maxwell I would love to know that lady is amazing how I thought she was dead but they keep coming up with statements of armor. And I always thought that those were false flags and then I find out that she's suing the Jeffrey Epstein estate for the money. She says she's old like it's  the Judge Joe Brown how could that possibly be that blows my mind that like that's a real minor power you know all right so the UFOs. So these the new video I thought the new videos aren't these videos that can already came out a couple of years ago. They just like Declassified them and officially acknowledged that they were real isn't that what happened because I remember when they came out because of Tom DeLonge so I guess. The I will say that the one in this one I watched it and it appeared to be much more.

Disc shaped and I remember I remember. I remember back when in 2018 thinking that it looked kind of like a tic-tac. But this one like it kept the way it moved. It looked like a  saucer does that Tripp did it did. It did. It look like a saucer to you guys. What could it be guys. What do you guys think is realistic. What is you guys what's your money on. What do you guys take it bets out here could it be a human tech could it be human. Tech is the entire thing a PSYOP is this a PSYOP guys I wouldn't be surprised honestly if it was like that episode of The Simpsons where they find the angel and it's just a  a viral video for something because if you look at the guys who were involved in this stuff like Robert Bigelow the guy who owns skinwalker ranch and was friends with Harry Reid and is one of the big reasons that Harry Reid did. Although D classifications and works with Tom DeLonge and those guys I mean maybe the whole thing is a  gimmick you know maybe they're gonna open a theme park or they're gonna fake alien invasion and then use it as an excuse to give us all like the mark of the beast in the emergency situation to follow I haven't started Ulysses.


Yet I was kind of wondering if I was gonna try to do it on like a stream. But everybody seems to be reading. Not allowed and I can seems maybe a little indulgent. But I know I have to read it out loud. I know I'm not gonna read it if I read it in my head. I need to have I need to hear the words so I'm probably gonna have to like maybe a devote an hour in the evening late at night when it's just me other than living room. I just read like a chapter or something it's work. It's Soulcraft. Let's call it Soulcraft I have to remember my place. The universe I have to remember I have to remember my path. I have to remember how to continue walking the path that I can see that I could hear to hear the yes to hear the voice to hear the echo I have to hear I have to get back to the yes. That's at the end of that book. So I got to read the book to get to it.

I'm a gamer. Now I hope to be. We're gonna set up the guy. We're trying to set up a office gaming rig and I would go there and I would play there if I could plug and play I would go there. The thing is people have said I they would like to see me play those like old the strategy games and the thing is I would like to do that in the abstract. But I'm very bad at them. I feel like I wouldn't get a lot of value and you guys wouldn't get a value a lot of value out of my poor performance of the game and it would probably just be more confusing and irritating for everyone involved because I would be getting frustrated or trying to not be frustrated but still struggling with it and you guys would all be knowing what I was doing wrong. It's like you'd be trying to watch me you know like what a puzzle together and you're like no no. No no not that or what are you doing oh god oh Jesus so I don't think that would be fun so I need to think of something. That is on the steep streets team or something as a PC game and that is very fun and light and low stakes and easy to do. Somebody recommended Katamari Damacy which sounded like a fun one where you've got to roll up the ball but for what I understand that's only on a console and we're not gonna have one so disco.

Elysium is a cool game but it's not the kind of thing I would want to play. It's. It's it's too much reading. I'm very bad at Mario Kart. Uh I guess Katamari Damacy is on PC now if it's not stream if it's on Steam I would do it. But I don't know if it is okay. I think I'll do that then I might do Katamari Damacy that'd be fun. I will never play for tonight. I do not like it at all I played it once in Maine when we were on tour. At least streamed it and I just ran around and got bored and then I got shot it sucked thumbs down to that game.

No thank you real bummer and Crum crummy experience don't like shooting games in general not ones where that requires a lot of a lot of accuracy. I guess because I'm not good. I never had a good eye coordination hand-eye coordination. That's why I never played games. When after I was out of schools. Cuz I wasn't really good at him so it was always more frustrating and I will late I was a lazy little turd. So I just sort of it was too hard I quit that was generally my experience. I was. I was a weak willed little snot. I quit I quit a lot of things I create a karate class I quit playing with saxophone I I was in Cub Scouts and I got the arrow of light and I was a wee below. But then I quit Boy Scouts and I claimed it was because I was too busy but in reality it was. They started making you do like calisthenics like they started making you do jumping. Jacks cry at climb ropes and I said.

This I thought we were gonna just make caramel and use make orange and eat it with apple slices. This sucks well it's getting dark out here alright. It's getting dark and it's been an hour. So I think I'll get off pretty soon. So I think the guys are gonna start streaming at 9:00. So you guys come back come on come on back y'all and you can stream at night oh wait. I took me longer than this to get on. So I'll stay a little longer and I remember now I I stayed on I stayed on less time because I had took me a while to get off but I'm kind of running out of steam too. Honestly. This has been a lot.

This is. This took a little bit more out of me than the last couple of them have and also I didn't bring a anyway to like this out here. So it's hard for me to. I don't want to go in and bother so yeah. So I'm gonna come off. What's my opinion on the chapo to fight line once again. I think it's great all right love. It. I'm glad. It's a it's a real thing that isn't made up by frauds and professional anxiety cases. I certainly not at all think it's hilarious Donald. Views is one of the great posters we still have. There aren't many left. But he's one of them and we should we should respect him for it. And I think people should always respect on and if you have a problem with him. You've got a problem with me sir. He's one of the few remaining true artists of the web. Tracht Rowling has basically a dead art except for him. He's like somebody who speaks Aramaic. Wow people are getting heated in the chat yelling at one another come on boys. It's all love. It's all love come on boys and girls. Let's krump and you guys like to krump. You. Guys like krumping at all does anyone remember krumping or is that before your time are you children. You never crumped. There was a movie about krumping. They made a documentary about crumpet. They used to dress like clowns and they did it. It was called clown krumping I kind of liked it. I liked it a lot. It was a sort of I thought it was sort of an American version of the haka sort of a faster sort of latinas haka. But then we stopped doing it. I wish we'd go back. Can we get back to krumping in my administration I will bring back crumpet. I swear that I shall put forth a new nation conceived and krumping Donald krump. Oh man can you imagine can you imagine if his name was Donald krump. If his name was Donald krump. He's a Cheeto folks. There's a damn cheeto on the White House. There is a literal cheeto in this White House. There is a cancer upon the presidency and there's a Cheeto. Upon that cancer she do in the white house that I ratted out I cheat over the white house to do do cheedo in the white house cheeto in the white house.


Guys I want to leave you guys with something from Pynchon I know that apparently the pension subreddit is mad at me somehow. But I just wanted to read another thing from against the day from later in the book. It's two characters who are basically roustabouts and hired guns who are now working in a Swiss mine. Among the many superstitions. Inside this mountain was a belief that the tunnel was neutral ground exempt not only from political jurisdictions. But from time itself. The anarchists and socialists on the shift had their own mixed feelings about history they suffered from it and it was also to be their Liberator if they could somehow survive to see the day in the shower battles. At the end of the shift.

The suffering could be read on each body as document written in insults to flesh and blood scars crookedness missing parts. They knew each other as comfortable men in the steam rooms of hydro. Hydro Pathak's for instance would not a mature bullet removals and bone settings cauterization x' and brandings. Some souvenirs were public and could be compared. Others were private and less likely to be talked about. One day reef happened to notice on floovio. What looked like a rain railroad map executed in scar tissue. What was that from you walk in between a couple of bobcats. An encounter with a Tetzel worm said floovio tyrannic and a new one on me said reef.

It's a snake with pause at gearheart four legs and three toes on each paw and a big mouth full of very sharp. Teeth hibernates here in inside the mountain tries to but anybody who wakes it up. God help them men have been known to quite quit work here claiming the potential worm was becoming enraged by all the drilling and explosions refigured. It was some kind of routine. They put the newcomers through this being the first tunnel job he'd run into it on some of Alpine Tommyknockers. He figured till he began to notice long flowing shapes in unexpected places. Tumblr's brought pistols into work and it took shots whenever they thought they saw Tetzel worm somewhat dynamite sticks and through them. The creature only became bolder or maybe more indifferent to their his fate.

Ain't exactly mine rats here in Europe speculated Philippe. The mountains are much older than America. Whatever lives in them had more time to evolve toward or lethal perhaps less amiable sort of creature. It's also a good argument for Hell added gearheart for some primordial plasma of hate and punishment at the center of the earth which takes out different forms the closer it can projected to the surface here. Under the Alps. It happens to become visible as the Tetzel world. It is comforting to imagine this as an outward and visible manifestation of something else chuckled one of the Austrians puffing on a cigar stub but sometimes the Tetzel worm is only a Tetzel worm. The really disturbing thing Fabio would whisper is when you see one and it looks up and sees that you are watching it sometimes it will run but if it doesn't then prepare to be attacked it helps if you don't look at its face for long before the dark you will know where it is because it will be screaming a high whirling scream. That's like the winter wood. Winter cold will creep in to occupy your bones. What you have the cut encounter Gerhard agreed it is with you forever. This is why I believe they are sent to us to some of us in particular for a purpose. What's that reef said to tell us that we shouldn't be doing this tunneling putting railroads. But we're not reef pointed out. The people who are paying us are do. They ever see the Tetzel worm. It visits them in their dreams and it looks like us added floovio if that was a little still to this because it's too  dark back here.


I shouldn't have started that I'm sorry alright guys. I'm going out. I'll see you guys tomorrow. I'll probably try to keep them around the same time. Maybe a little earlier so that I can get in here while it's still light out or get a goddamn light. Anyway bye bye.
