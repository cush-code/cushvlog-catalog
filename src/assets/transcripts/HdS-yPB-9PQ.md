Baby here I am oh man the canals and the bridges the embankments and cuts they blasted and dug with their sweat and their guts. They never drank water but whiskey by pints and their shantytowns rang with their songs and their fights navigator navigator rise up and be strong. The morning is here and there's work to be done take your ticket your shovel and them all dynamite. We're to shift a few tons of the seriously delight yes to shift a few tons of this earthly delight. Hey folks sorry about wednesday I was not in a place where I could get very good wi-fi. So it wasn't been feasible to stream but I definitely even if I can't do two streams a week. I want to at least do the book club every week. The vibe stream maybe not every week like. I don't know about next week. I do want to do more with chris though I want to do the one I last weeks with chris. I thought was really fun and I honestly prefer that to just like trying to read the comments because honestly they're hard to follow and not a lot of them are great. I gotta tell you guys a lot of bad comments a lot so it's hard to parse the good ones from the bad ones much funner to do it with chris. So I'm gonna try to make that like maybe every other week because I don't want him to feel like he has to do it every week but anyway one thing.

I want to do every week is do the damn book club so let's just start off very quickly with chapter two of reconstruction by eric vonner. So one thing that fauna really lays out when he's breaking down the social order that is emerging and the social conflicts that are emerging in these in the southern states. Specifically is among the different populations who are ready to accept union victory and accept federal authority being reimposed. There is a consistent um pattern whereby any group will sell out basically the the the interest of any other group that they do not feel that they are part of so like the white southern unionists for the most part are perfectly happy to say the union ones. Slavery is abolished but that their rights need to be in some sense over held over the rights of the freights of the of the newly freed slaves. But it's important to note. This was not simply a mechanism of racial discrimination by itself. Fauner points out that the relatively prosperous free colored population as was known then of new orleans was also perfectly willing to sell out the interests of of former slaves in exchange for being sort of affirmed at the top of a social hierarchy and it is important to remember and something that I think gets lost in a lot of the um.

The top the way that we frame civil rights the way that we frame um like the virtue of citizenship is one of the things that's that like does make like the a black american population seem to stand in for sort of like the virtuous the most virtuous of us as in the people in the united states who have benefited the least at the expense of others. A lot of that boils down to the fact that they didn't have anybody to sell out. There was nobody that they could have tried to negotiate against and sacrifice their interests in favor of because they were at the bottom of the totem pole. Now what that means though is that as a result the black experience of america is one that has with it like an actual a enduring solidarity that transcends class that there is something like black destiny or or black rights that need to be considered by people even if they might not you know even if you're doing better than that than other members of that group. Economically there's still a um an obligation there which is one of the big reasons that you know black people when they do vote vote overwhelmingly democratic regardless of what their economic um position is.

But it's not because people are better. It's not that the culture they create is more virtuous. It's because there is nowhere else to go and one of the reasons. I think that america is such a monstrous country in its history and and why it's it has become. The country that has sort of remade. The world in its image is because thanks to proscribe the existence of proscribed classes like blacks and land that could be endlessly explorated from native americans meant that social solidarity was essentially never never needed to be when it was never forced into being through conflict because it could always social conflict by those among those who are part of the police could always be offloaded somewhere else on to somebody else. First racial minorities in the united states itself and then later foreigners elsewhere and now we're in a situation where um the the frontier is closed. The myth is over as greg. Brandon has pointed out and we don't know how to be social. We do not know how to accept the idea that there is obligation to other people that transcends our individual interests because american history has essentially been able to avoid dealing with that question at every point by sacrificing the interests of somebody else somewhere else or someone who looks some different way and that can't happen anymore and now we don't know what to do and we're having a gigantic nationwide nervous breakdown. Out of that.

Now the reason that I think looking at reconstruction and looking at a different reconstruction that might have happened given the actual materials that were in play is that if because is that by accepting and and teasing out the notion of a of an alternative of a country that does come to terms with obligations and social solidarity and what it means to be you know a citizen beyond just personal autonomy at all costs that we had the up. But we could have done it because to say otherwise is this to say that essentially is to take the the the pessimistic. Like the doom approach that well we were tainted because we had this land and because we had these racial categories we were doomed from the beginning well if that's the case then why do anything why care about politics why focus on any of this stuff unless it's honestly a way for people who are relatively comfortable to accept that to to stop feeling guilty about it to say. Essentially you know what I wish we were in a country where what that had some sort of social obligatory structures and I wish that there was humanity to our interactions and it wasn't just cold-blooded calculation but that darn racism those darn.

That's what are we gonna do oh well. What are you gonna do about it. I I guess i. I can feel a little bad that I ended up at the top of this situation. But there's nothing I can do about it. So 

[09:02](https://youtu.be/HdS-yPB-9PQ?t=09m02s)

I can blame racists in the past and races in the present none of whom are me and that really does let us all off the hook. I mean all kinds any kind of black pill you want to take any kind of doom-based politics. You want to take whether it's whether it's a progressive one that emphasizes america's racism or a super racist one that says that because we have a multicultural society we can't have anything good that's all just a way to avoid the obligations of being a human. A human and the obligations we have to each other that transcend any of these history which is never a real conception. It is always a story we tell ourselves. We can always tell ourselves any story. There's no answer.

Here there is no true thing that we can drill out of our past. We can notice patterns and recognize patterns and try to recognize patterns when they emerge around us. But there is no facts. There is no fundamental thing that we can take from these. There are only stories we can tell ourselves and I am trying to tell a story that leaves the aperture of possibility open forever for for change.

Because to do otherwise is to is to abnegate your is to abdicate your responsibility as a human so in this chapter. Fauna also talks about the reconstruction governments of the war years because reconstruction is thought to have begun in 1865 but the union held huge chunks of southern territory through military occupation starting in 1862 and then expanding over the course of the war. So there were essentially like reconstructed governments already being built before the war ended and he goes through them. They were in tennessee maryland kentucky and louisiana.

Those are the ones he focuses on um and what happened in. Most of these was a miniature version of what the civil war was in general which was an overthrow of a quasi-aristocratic quasi-feudal planter elite by small holders and the emergent urban merchant class. The bourgeois revolution the continuation and the fulfillment of the bourgeois revolution that began with the american revolution but which was essentially arrested by the creation of the constitutional order and what's interesting is when you look at the record of andrew johnson as a military appointed governor of tennessee. During the war he looked like a progressive. He looked like a man who had been fundamentally altered by the experience of the war who who was noted for his stern hand to rebels to his his vehement prosecution of of traitors and eventually to his sort of open-handed treatment of former slaves. But what's really important to note though is what was propelling. This from.

Johnson was the resentment of slave owners felt by a guy who at the end of the day was a quasi-illiterate tailor and who had never been accepted and never could be accepted by the the the best parts of tennessee society and had with him sort of a nixonian grudge and that's what powered his politics. That's what made him a unionist during the war. That's what powered him towards suppressive the suppression of the pro-secession faction in tennessee. But then once he becomes president and his and his resentment goes from a planter elite that is now dethroned to the new ruling class of washington. Dc. I.e radical republicans that resentment goes that powers him and now powers him in a different direction towards re-enthroning. All the people he used to hate in his mind for the good of the poor whites but in reality for the re-inscribement of all of the most reactionary quasi-feudal elements of antebellum society and the other thing that I think really needs to be emphasized. In this second chapter is a theme that's going to be important to focus on as you go through the whole of reconstruction which is a push and pull between the necessities of prosecuting the war which meant confiscation of property which meant abrogation of all the liberal values. That that the the wig the whig model that governed the union sides governing ruling class held and those very ideological precepts and with them the the desire especially powerfully felt by lincoln to keep the borders. The border slave states on the union side I honestly think that that focus of lincoln's is probably his biggest blind spot. Over the course of the war. It's understandable because obviously you don't want the border states to secede but once you get to the middle of the war once you get to the like the point where military occupation of these places is already established where like tennessee is under military application maryland delaware under military occupation hell. Louisiana is mostly under military occupation. They don't really get a say anymore. You don't really have to kiss their asses so much eh but lincoln was operating from the same deliberative ideology.

[15:12](https://youtu.be/HdS-yPB-9PQ?t=15m12s)

The same liberal orthodoxy that dominated the republican party and that liberal orthodoxy is and this is a thing that richard white talks about much more explicitly in the republic for which it stands that liberal orthodoxy is one of the big hindrances to the war to the recognition of the actual implications of the war which is that if we are overthrowing this social order then certain things are going to have to happen to carry that out one slavery is going to have to be abolished but also the power of the slave owners and their ability to exercise. Power is going to also have to be abolished but to do that would require a reordering of the state's relationship to citizenry that was anathema to the um center of gravity of opinion in the republican party and of course the the financial and merchant interests that funded the republican party and the thing that needs to be pointed out is that there were two things pushing against that liberal orthodoxy. One was just the exigencies of the war itself like benjamin butler and sherman and these guys who did radical stuff like slaves as contraband and then giving them land as as Sherman did when he was marching through the carolinas that they were not doing ideologically they were done out of necessity. I need I need bodies I need people to do to dig ditches and and build fortifications why not use these people who literally are begging me to take them in or or sherman. I have these people.

I don't have any means to feed or take care of them give them some land and let them farm themselves and then I can focus on winning the war so that's part of it. But the other thing the other most crucial pressure that pushed the war effort and reconstruction policy passed where the average republican officeholder was comfortable with were the slaves themselves. It was a it was a pressure from below that generated the real productive tension with the governing ideology of the north and between the governing ideology worth of the north and the project of winning the war and why the war is being fought okay so let's go now to chapter three which is where fauna breaks down.

The different ways that um the ex-slave population assert their um their rights their and their independence from the the slave economy and the slave society that was generated by it and fauna points out very astutely and something that I think gets overlooked. A lot is that we talk about reconstruction and the end of slavery as a challenge to getting and as a challenge of getting the whites of the south and the north for that matter to be comfortable accepting black people as equal citizens. But there was a flip side to that which is getting former slaves to accede to being part of a white r ruled political order. How the hell do you go from being the property of people the people who prescribed through your skin color a a a a non-human basically status and then living amongst them as equals or even punitive equals of any kind like just as contract freedom which is what as someone who connects how can you even imagine that you could exercise contract freedom with these people and it really does suggest that you know the that with all druthers being had that what would have been the preferable thing at least for the former slaves would have been black self-determination.

You know I mean I the kind of stuff that the communist party pushed for in the 1930s self-determination for the black belt like not just land but political autonomy within the land that they would have had and that's actually something that there's a book fire on the mountain that somebody recommended to me in this chat and I read it's it's pretty interesting. It's an alternative history which I love book where um john brown's raid is successful and it sparks a rolling slave rebellion that over the course of years leads to general um a generalized rebellion against slavery throughout the south and the establishment of like a free black republic in the american south which becomes socialist which links up with european socialist currents to the point where eventually by the mid 20th century. The united states itself has had a socialist revolution and is now allied with this former part of itself. But the problem with that dream is that it was black. Self-determination was essentially impossible to enforce wherever it came into conflict with the white prerogative of power simply because there was no There was no mechanism for it the same way that the the native americans were essentially unable to effectively combat the westward expansion of the united states.

Former slaves were in a similar situation where because of the fact that they had been literally deprived of everything but their lives for their entire existences upon freedom. The the they did not have access to the capital or the organizational forms or the that could have effectively anyway made an assertion of autonomy against white society they had to collaborate. They were cursed to have to collaborate with with whites in order to gain any kind of self-determination but not by themselves and what fauner points out here is that in places where white prerogative existed like labor. Like this the like labor conditions and and the conditions by which labor is sold and also the disposition of land. There was very little that former slaves could do to assert their autonomy places that they could though were in domesticity and and religious practice and then with domesticity. You see a wholesale retraction out of the labor force of a former slave of black women. Who were gonna work at home. Like was the ideal among white families. Women were not supposed to work outside the home. Ideally there was a domestic sphere and and part of black self-determination and as the as slavery ended was withdrawing women and children from the workforce and into a domestic situation um and of course that wasn't able to be universalized and in many cases it was resisted by local white authorities but it was a a assertion of of autonomy.

There is an interesting quote though I wanted to read from the this chapter where fonder is talking about this assertion of of autonomy and he says family itself rather than a white owner or overseer now decided where and when black women and children would work and I think that's an interesting sentence because it points to the way that that invisible hand of the market that of course is not invisible and is it's is actually you know the the The concerted rule of of capitalists does its most effective super structural work at mystifying coercive relationships because the family was not going to be able to decide if women and children worked. Women and children might have to work if they need the money if they need the money they might have to have someone go out and work in the field or work. Domestically. They don't have that they they will if they want to stay fed have to accede to that but they will not be forced to they will not be directly told to by a white owner or overseer. It will be just the market. It will be the fact that they don't have enough money and so that becomes it's felt as a voluntary relationship. But in reality it is as coercive as the slave relationship.

[25:31](https://youtu.be/HdS-yPB-9PQ?t=25m31s)

But because it is felt as autonomy it is it is de-alienated in that respect and that's one of the things that has powered capitalism to the heights that it has is that it can generate a lot of social misery that is impossible to place the source of by people who experience it now when it comes to labor. The assertion of black autonomy boiled down to a demand for land ownership which is obvious when you think about it. That was the cinequinone of freedom for all americans going back to the revolutionary ethos like yeoman. The omen small holder was the ideal citizen someone who did not owe their labor to another and could sustain themselves on their own land and it was very it's kind of amazing when you see the sort of bafflement and and outrage by a lot of even northerners at the temerity of the slaves to insist upon ownership of land. When that was the fundamental expression of american liberty the 1860 republican platform was um was advertised with the slogan vote yourself a farm which culminated in the passage of the homestead act of course. Many balked at the idea of giving just giving the land which of course super absurd because the idea that this has happened worked for the idea that this was a handout is monstrous because these are literally people whose labor had created the wealth in the first place if they were owed anything.

It was the land itself but even more absurdly is. A lot of northerners insisted that there was no authority to take the land that that the limited prerogative of the federal government did not extend to the to abrogating land from people. But there's another quote from this chapter where a former slave while talking to. A union officer who is not being enthusiastic about the idea of taking land because it's against it goes beyond. His authority says if you had the right to take master slaves you had the right to take master's land too which is obviously the case because until the civil war slaves were property. The distinction between slaves and land from a legal point of view you might argue moral but again if morality was entered into this.

Then that equi that equation would never have existed was arbitrary and that really is the entire role. That's the goal. That's the um that is the reason that we have things like the constitution and the reason that we have our political institutions is to draw arbitrary lines of power which protect private prerogatives and protect the existing power structures and resource distributions that we have and then call that natural and I think.

But I think it's very point important to point out the slay. The case for redistributing land to former slaves was legally as I've said and morally unassailable you can't argue against it. It's on its face true and it didn't matter because the only thing that yields power. The only thing that makes power yield is power and there was not sufficient organized power to assert black rights to land beyond what in limited areas. They were given almost as experiments or as ad hoc measures of war. But one of the big things that created conflict between the um the new regime. The new reconstruction regimes and the ex-slaves is that ex-slaves wanted to pursue a subsistence agricultural living. They wanted to grow food for their families and maybe grow enough cash crops for a little bit of folding money.

What they did not want to do was spend 12 hours a day in the field to grow cotton because they knew through experience that that money would not go to them which of course was true and you actually saw a parade of northern do-gooders who went to the south to buy up plantations as experiments and have ex-slaves grow cotton again experimentally and then sell it as a way to raise. Their standard of living was the expectation at all points that the lion's share of the profit would go to the person who had who had who had assumed the risk of buying the distressed plantation property and not you know the people who actually had worked the land their entire lives and who by any measure should have profited from all of it and so the the the prerogative the the the free slave desire for a subsistence livelihood was in direct conflict with the drive toward capital accumulation which had defined the plantation agriculture before the war and was going to reassert itself after the war and then just to end up the other thing that fauna talks about is the emergence of a political organization and expression on the part of the the black population in general and then later the former slave population.

 as the as reconstruction begins in the immediate aftermath of the war. The leadership of um the black population that asserted itself in what was what in for the most part came down to self-organized political conventions that met voted on resolutions demands for land demands for rights and treatment and then essentially set them as sent those resolutions as entreaties to washington. But they had no actual legal sanction. But what they were were the first attempts to organize and create a civic culture that could then interact with the the governing culture over time and at the immediate aftermath of the war. The vast majority of the people who showed up to those conventions and spoke and wrote the resolutions were were free blacks from before the war and ministers many of the teachers and veterans essentially those members of the black community who had some extended interaction with white institutions at some level which gave them the the toolkit basically to go to a convention and and you know organize it and and interact with the the government and such now as time went on that changed though as reconstruction deepened and as former slaves in the up country and in the deep plantation regions as they came to self-organize those conventions that convened further off from the time of the end of the war became more and more dominated by actual former plantation slaves who were learning essentially the ropes of civic engagement as as they emerged from a condition of servitude and just to let wrap up on the third chapter fauna talks about the endemic and horrifying nature of violence carried out by whites against former slaves all throughout the south. Thousands and thousands of murders assaults at this point. Not really the lynchings that we think of like the ritualized community lynchings but more essentially guerrilla attacks like attacking people in their homes or on the road um and what that shows more than anything was that for reconstruction to have any success and I think and this was something that was it dawned on northern readership pretty.

[34:51](https://youtu.be/HdS-yPB-9PQ?t=34m51s)

Early on There would have to be a significantly punitive approach to dealing with former slave owners. There would have to be a continuation of violence and that reality was the one thing that lyndon johns or lyndon. Johnson andrew johnson could not countenance and the real disaster more than anything of presidential reconstruction which happened after the lincoln assassination and before the radicals reasserted control of the process was that he wanted to allow the former slave owners essentially to get off scot-free and what they were gonna do with that freedom. Is pretty clear which was intimidate the former slaves into a condition of of essentially de facto slavery through horrifying application of violence and this honestly for me is the thing that makes me most most believe that a second lincoln term a reconstruction under lincoln instead of. Johnson would have been fundamentally different and would have changed the trajectory. I don't know how much but somewhere from where we ended up because I just simply do not believe that lincoln having fought the war the way he had and would have allowed or would have been um comfortable in any way with allowing that level of violence to determine the social relations in the post-war south especially when he had an entire party at his heels ready to ready and willing to affirm a putative approach to the former slave owners and that is why I really want to you know do something with that idea because it is one of those places where like the shadow of history sort of casts its paul and and you get you just shiver and you think what could have been but but yeah everybody but andrew johnson. By the end of the war knew that there was no way that you could just wish away social conflict in fact a white former governor of north carolina and I'll end with this quote said in 1865 with reference to emancipation.

We are at the beginning of the war and that is the reality of it and some people were aware of that and accepting of it. Others weren't and the real tragedy of american history. One of them is that one of the people who wasn't or if he was he didn't care was the president of the united states okay so that's the overview so we're gonna do chapters four and five for next wednesday. If anybody has wants to talk about it a little bit here. I'd be happy too um. Someone asked would lincoln have abolished the constitution. Lincoln loved the constitution and the problem is everybody loved the constitution. I don't think that the constitution would have been abolished.

You know like that. I do.

I do see a ability after a protracted conflict after a protracted like essentially a second civil war which would have happened planters and their allies would have resisted that the exigencies the realities of administering this like. I said the the republicans were pushed way beyond their comfort zone in terms of abrogating authority from the constitution by the exigencies of prosecuting the war if that war had continued to be prosecuted not as a ground campaign with armies but as the suppression of a guerrilla movement and the standing up of a new like multi-racial order in the south that that process that dynamic of the constitution sort of being pressed and and the verities that underlie it being challenged and undermined.

I think that would have continued too and then maybe even that lincoln but maybe you know maybe a sumner administration or something says all right let's thing up and really that was that would have been a necessity to affirm a a political structure for this country that would have been flexible and um flexible enough to accommodate subaltern demands and it would not obviously have led to some sort of peaceful um socialism. You know. I think that the the german example pretty clearly shows that that's not in the cards that capitalism knows where the line is and will fight for it. But every move towards the creation of a of a genuinely multi- racial and multi-ethnic class means that those points of conflict become more and more contestable by the working class which is the opposite of what we had in this country where at every step every working class explosion has been contained and nullified over time. The most sustained one of course being in the early 30s being contained into the the structure of the new deal and then over the course of the next 30 years sort of dissipated and and co-opted and neutralized and now we are in the situation where class as a felt social experience no longer exists and has to be rebuilt and any way you slice it. The institutions that the constitution has left us with are huge hindrances to that and are eventually going to have to be directly conflicted with episode.

500 will not be a clip show. There's gonna be plenty of new stuff. I've not seen the new curtis dock. Yet. I will though I gotta watch it. Soon how long is that thing oh man six hours jeepers christmas okay. I better get I better get cracking then eight wow 10. Holy mackerel. It's it's it actually never ends you start watching it and you watch it forever. It's like the entertainment an infinite chest. I did watch community to the end and I did like the yahoo season. I think the yahoo season gets underrated. Keith. David is great in it have. I read the killer angels who do you think you're talking to of course. I read the killer angels. I remember the killer angels when I was like 12. I even went to 

I saw gettysburg in the theater as a little kid and most brutally. I saw guys and generals in theater which is genuinely the worst movie. I've ever paid to see and I watched the whole and what's beautiful about it is. Yes. It is noxious confederate apologia but it is also a terrible movie just from the point of view of filmmaking it sucks and the funniest thing about. It is that like with most civil war movies. It saves money with its battle scenes by just having reenactors do it. They just say hey you freaks who already own your own period detail accurate guns and uniforms you guys come into a battle and we'll film it well. The thing is the the problem is the average confederate american war. Civil war reenactor is like a 45 year old like carpet salesman who's got like a gut like a michelin tire around his neck around his stomach and then you watch these shows and you watch these battle scenes and you just see these round ass guys like eating mini balls and it's that's not the civil war. The civil war was like 90 pound 18 year olds shooting each other but there is a scene where where former senator george allen from virginia and a bunch of other guys play dress up as confederate generals and sing along to the bonnie blue flag that is a genuinely surreal and hilarious moment very just classic kitsch.

[47:10](https://youtu.be/HdS-yPB-9PQ?t=47m10s)

I was in vegas this time last year time certainly flies or does it. I don't know it's been like one long day but also 500 years um oh. Somebody else asked me a question on twitter that I thought would be a good thing to answer here because it is an interesting question. Somebody said they want to know what is what would be was there a european equivalent of the 1905 revolution and yeah. It's the 1848 revolutions and the fact that they happened in 1848 and it happened in 1905 and russia tells you really all you need to know which is russia was way way way behind europe and and by the time it had its its first stirrings of of like a social ferment away from um. It's so the the social ferment that comes from the impos imposition of capitalism into a feudal system. That's what the 1848 revolution was and by that point in russia you literally still had enslave a land land held like baron held serfs in russia. You did they had they had a serfdom. That was more like in more embedded and and then serfdom had been in continental europe for in some cases hundreds of years and so they didn't get. There. They didn't get their first like explosion of that until 8 1905.

I have read late victorian holocaust by mike davis great book. Why does everyone think carter was so great if anybody thinks carter is great. It's got to be there's the only people I can think of think carter is great are people who like that he his post-presidential career which I think is largely commendable. People who like the fact that some american president has called israeli occupation apartheid which also commendable if you liked his presidency though it's either because you're just a contrarian who who wants to stand up for somebody who was sort of unfairly maligned and honestly. He was unfairly maligned for a lot of the stuff that people blamed him for publicly like the hostage crisis. Although you know they didn't have to give the shah a sanctuary and let him go and do get his cancer treatment. But I think a lot of the people like it like it because like him because they feel like he was honest with the american people in a way that like reagan wasn't and that he was punished for being honest and that is just that's perfect liberalism.

It is the because of course carter was telling the american people stop being materialistic stop stop measuring freedom by what you can buy and what you can spend without giving any indication that he was going to change the underlying economic engine of this country which depended on that he just wanted you to feel bad. He wanted you to to to have a little hull monitor in your head to to judge you for your for your desires while still living in a society completely dominated by consumerism and more than anything that's just bad politics and of course. It got completely rinsed by reagan saying no we'll cut taxes and everybody can keep partying I mean that's the thing it's like carter was partly human carter.

I don't think is a real reptile but he was a real liberal. He was a real ideologically committed liberal and that is that makes you an enemy to to the human race even if you don't know that you are even if you think you are. That's one of the beauties of liberalism is. It can convince anybody that they are doing things for everyone's good when in fact they're just reinforcing and protecting the system from from It's from the downward pressures from pressures from below and of course. He had a very bad foreign policy. I mean he sent money to the mujahideen before the soviets even invaded in order in part to trigger an invasion.

What was the this is interesting somebody says what was the deal classical when was the decade classical liberalism stopped being progressive. It was about the time that the term progressive was discussed was coined the eight the late 1800s. It's important to note that this it's the the people who have been progressives since the turn of the century. The the tier of people who are in in that middle tier of academics politicians managers lawyers professional managerial types. They were in the 19th century. They had a strict adherence to small government orthodoxy hard money and survival of the fittest social doctrines and what happened over time is that that went from being a 

The most humane way to organize the government because it opposed monarchy concentrated power and slavery because the the anti-slavery forces in the north. The the the northern whigs who are opposed to slavery did so through because they believed it was morally wrong to for anyone to be compelled to labor by anything other than the market. The market should be what compels you to labor not everybody of course that doesn't stand for every abolitionist wendell. Phillips for example and john brown for that matter didn't think that but that was the pervading orthodoxy it was the most humane way to organize capitalism but by the end of the gilded age that system had broken down and the new people who came to that social or just came to those social positions. It's not the same people remember they're dying out and they're being replaced by new people and the new ones they're replaced by. They find that that orthodoxy doesn't work anymore and their new understanding of the most humane way to organize capitalism is through mixed economy. Social safety net welfare the the things that become the progressive model that has dominated ever since. But it's the same social strata all along all right and just a couple more.

I'm gonna go thoughts on st louis. I don't really have thought any thoughts about the city. I do have some thoughts about the saint I don't know if you guys know this. But he was actually he's the king of he was king of france. I believe the only king of france to have been sanctified or beatified and he was a very very earnest and and passionate crusader but also a very bad one He did a couple of crusades that were complete botches and he actually died on campaign in africa of dysentery. His duty house out in a camp and then they made him a saint for that why do. I hate the english. They're the one I mean. I don't hate the english like as people but like english civilization. Those are the guys their combination of technology and bureaucracy and when I say technology I mean things like protestantism and and you know their naval naval stores and like that double entry bookkeeping whatever that they but whatever bundle of things they came together not only gave them a technological spear sort of to to use in the in the battle for world resources.

But it also generated a culture of bureaucracy that allowed them to carry out monstrous acts of colonial domination while maintaining a civil veneer and a functioning um political culture in the metropole and that model is the model that all capitalism has followed ever since we were just took the baton from them. That's why you could just give me give me a time machine and let me just honestly. I don't even have to give napoleon like a modern navy because what would they know they wouldn't know how to do with it. Just give them some barrels of ketchup packets to just go out and then they put the ketchup on their food and then they don't have to worry about their teeth falling out and this dumb limeys have to. You know they have to turn back because they ran out of produce and they're all they got all got giant bruises from their freaking scurvy because that the bureaucratic culture that that alienation that is central to english social order and that we then transmogrified into like a mad dog settler colonial version of it has has rendered.

Meaning has destroyed any meaning beyond that which can be quantified has destroyed. Social meaning has destroyed the soul and we're all now living in this desanctified soulless universe that these empires and still around which is how is that like people like people are often horrified by the turks for not recognizing the armenian genocide which they should be or for the japanese for acting like they didn't do anything wrong in manchuria but look at the english whining crying that their empire is gone when the fact is that for the crimes their empire committed they should have just had the entire island detonated and sunk into the north sea. They got to keep their gall all right. I think that I think bertovo is going to be streaming. Fortnite pretty soon so. I'm going to log off hopefully god willing and the creek don't rise wednesday. We will be talking about chapters 4 5 4 5 of reconstruction bye-bye.
