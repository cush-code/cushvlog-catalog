I think I'm going I'm still waiting to confirm there. I am anybody on ok. We got some folks. It looks like hi everybody. I already lost a little guy a little. What do you call it the dampener. I think it's in the other room but hopefully it'll still sound ok. I just need a little confirmation from the gang that I'm sound alright and then we can get going. How's everybody doing today beautiful day here in Brooklyn. Sun's out guns out. It's nice like 80 something. It's looking good thank you to everyone who's been saying that I look weirdly thin lately. It's nice. But I'll take it wherever I get it and I cut my own hair. I used the shaver I shaved my face. Irish shaved my beard down and I realized that when I just let it go - like Marxian lengths that it adds like 15 pounds to my head like I do look like the Zardoz Scott head coming in just waiting for guns and food bars to come shooting out of my mouth. The penis is evil the gun is good but then when I click trim it down a little bit. It's like oh my face actually. It's like it's narrowed by a good third. So I think I'm gonna try to not let it get that wild again especially since I'm doing so much streaming now and there's just my face. There's just thought there's now there's hundreds of hours of me on YouTube with just my head in the middle of a frame and then of course you throw the hat on and it's easier to obscure the rapidly declining hairline.

Well thanks thank you for everyone and I'll try to keep that in mind. I'll try to keep myself a little more narrowly headed to than I was well. Someone's saying my last stream was good thank you I get a little worried when I get abstract you know talking about the need to infuse meaning in public space through ritual and like a renewed religious traditions. I know that that's kind of out there and I get worried about losing my ability to translate down to a more general understanding level. But I'm still gonna try goddamn it. Even if it just ends up being dismissed by most everyone is gibberish. It's all I it's. It's what makes sense to me right now and that's all I can talk about. I can't I can't be false. I can't be fall for this long in front of the camera. Like for me. I really find that this whole set up is like a truth. It's like in a tear. It's like Errol Morris is antara Tron or something we're just knowing that there's this audience out there. This Benthamite panoptic on and while I'm trying to like reason things out it kind of squeezes all of the artifice away because I can't maintain it.

It becomes too difficult to keep the lie straight and I end up having to just I have to just come clean just so that I can keep talking and fill the space with words. So that's why I've really really enjoyed this and I think that honestly doing these has been really important to do my personal spiritual evolution to get to get real with it so thank you for anyone who is still finding any meaning out of these because that's what makes me feel like it's still worth doing and not totally self indulgent. So today I wanted to talk about something that's a little more maybe. A little more grounded a little more historical because I've been reading Reagan land I got an advance copy through my media connections of the new Rick Pearlstein book that covers the Carter Administration. I've talked about it a bit before on I'm here and it's it's very good. I just finished nineteen. It's it's divided in years and I just finished 1977 and Oh may have I'm I got. My hands I'm rubbing them together but already there's been a lot of great stuff and what's really cool about Pearlstein is it. I think more than anyone. He understands the the real dialectical dynamic even if he isn't really a dialectician and he's like more he has a liberal Sensibility and you know his narrative is evolutionary without. You know being fully three-dimensional.

But he he definitely gets that there is like a conflict driving the emergence of like the Republican Party as we understand it like we got here through a process. It's like not. It's it's true to say like oh. These are the same Republicans they've always been but that's also obscures the fact that over the years they've changed. It's like a ship of theseus thing. They fused and shifted and it's the same people pursuing the same political goals. To see that's the important thing is that the the base the real base of power of the Republican Party. America's capitalist class has not changed what's changed to spend the culture that changes within the economy have produced that requires the Republican Party which is a political institution and has to reflect some sort of will of the people in some way to be legitimate as a political institution in a putative democracy so they have to reflect the frustrations and an alienation of their voters as neoliberalism.

Immiseration. I'm talking of course about you know from the middle class and lower Republican voters including upper middle class because people point out. Oh a lot of these Trump voters they don't have. They're not economically insecure they have a lot of money but the thing is is. It's not necessarily even your actual immiseration. It's the fear of immiseration the fear of falling as bear. Barbara Ehrenreich said apparently the the rich people who like Trump the most are the ones in congressional districts that have the most poverty but are still you know like segregative. So like white poverty. You know places in like Appalachia in the Midwest that have been hammered by the industrialization and they still are doing well so you can't say that they're miserable but their neighbors are doing poorly and their kids. They know are gonna do worse than that so there's anxiety even if there is an actual immiseration so the conditions on the ground for everybody who hasn't been at the very top of the distribution of income in this country over the last 40 years have been. You either you have lost it significantly and materially or you fear losing it both of which create alienation from America.

Being the the the the project of America and that alienation has to go somewhere and the job of the Republican Party is to keep it reactionary to keep it fixated on cultural demons. Cultural spirits brought up by the conjuring wand of the manufacturing of consent immigrants. Minorities communists whatever the abortion providers call cultural Marxists and that's been because things have gotten worse and the Republican Party has to reflect that what pro scene gets is that that reality that reality of of a widening gap between the the commitment to the project of America between the people who run the Republican Party and the people who vote for the Republican Party has led to a cultural shift within the Republican Party towards the sort of blood and soil anti-intellectual tub-thumping populism of Trump. But it's not just culture changing significantly. It was resolving a conflict in the Republican Party between the internationalist wing which is Wall Street which was embodied by Eisenhower or beating Taft at the 52 convention and then and then and then Rockefeller Nelson Rockefeller being the avatar of that you Wall Street Wall Street republicanism that saw its interest aligned along a international line because they were the capitalists who had the most information right because you can ever say that the ruling class rules by their own interests for their own interests. They rule for the perception of their own interests and usually those are very close because they have a lot of information in power and that gives them the tendrils to recognize the terrain more than 

[10:29](https://youtu.be/OQsp7ZtFxOM?t=10m29s)

Schmucks who don't have that kind of coordinated intelligence gathering capability so they have the most information which means that they can control the situation more. But it's not total. There's a gap the dunning-kruger thing that's inside every institution in person and but they were closer to knowing with the score. They were closer after World War two looking at the global war global economy and the right and the Soviet Union and say this is going to be. This is not going to be a military conflict. This is we are going to win by Doc creating a new dominant economic model that will be hegemonic. We will replace the patchwork exploitative system extractive system of European colonialism and we were replaced it with a world system of raw raw production extraction of the third world leading to consumption in the first. That's what we're gonna build and that requires standing up the economies of all our former enemies and infusing them with capital and eventually helping them establish their own competitive industrial economies to compete with us because they needed to be strong because otherwise they would be defeated.

They saw that vision but there were other Americans who ended up getting represented by Goldwater and then Reagan often thought of it's the Sun Belt Cowboys who won who won the battle for the soul of the Republican Party. Those guys were local manufacturers mostly the you're talking about a regional powerhouse. He mentions the Allen Bradley company in in Milwaukee. A perfect example. It's a local like Industrial Supply Company that is also one of the premier funders of race science are charles. Murray got a ton of money from them. They have their own think tank that trying to prove the the like the racial superiority of white people and and they've spent millions of dollars over the years on the kind of direct mail grassroots stimulation that led to the creation of that that that movement Robert Welch the founder of the John Birch Society was a small local candy manufacturer in Massachusetts.

The Knott's Berry family who ended up who had who now have a theme park in Orange County and were like one of the one of the four families that basically monopolized agriculture cash crop agriculture in California. In the 20th century. Another reactionary funder and and font and that spoke to that middle class who didn't have that they didn't have the interests they weren't they were being exploited by Wall Street. They didn't have interest in common Wall Street and so they were actually their real. Interests were opposed to the broad category of capital but they didn't know that but they because they couldn't see the one in front of them because of the ideology that they had they couldn't see the near exploiter but they could see the far one and they hated them and so the near exploiter. These these new right guys who ended up becoming you know from young Americans for freedom and from the Goldwater campaign and then to Reagan who provided the other poll the poll that said we don't need this international.

We should we don't need to accommodate and what that also meant is. We don't have to accommodate to culture shift which is why Wall Street liberalism was more socially liberal because it knew the larger game was capitalism versus communism. They knew that that was the real stakes because they were international in their outlook and that meant that when there's discontent along racial lines you have to deal something about it or you will undermine yourself against your enemy. The nearsightedness the nearsighted small producers didn't know if they think we're unable to essentially to perceive that level. They couldn't even see that dimension of reality because they're too focused on their own piggish local consumption and they said no we confront the Soviet Union and we destroy anyone who tries to undermine our culture and that became the real argument and by the time Pearlstein stalking when Reagan is goes from being chipped close almost getting Ford's nomination in 76 and then getting the nomination in 80. He's describing the moment when that bipartisan neo liberal consensus slams down right when oh the broader like political economy.

Economic questions that used to be the domain of the political parties are no longer gonna be on the political table because neither one of us are gonna mention them. Neither party can now talk about stuff like deindustrialization you know trade debt or trade deficits because to be a world reserve currency. In the post Bretton Woods system. You have to be a consumer and not a producer industrially be that it doesn't work the other way. We have to have a trade deficit and a big one to float the dollar as because that's what floats that's what makes the dollar circulate. That's what's that's the that's the capillary action of the vascular system of the world economy where the dollar is the reserve currency we have to have run a trade deficit which means we have to dia industrialized and neither party will argue about that and they didn't for years so it became so what filled.

The void was culture and thought culture filled the void completely and then you have more secure white people. The white people who are less touched personally by the by the immiseration caused by deindustrialization. They they have essentially the luxury to pursue social liberalism and claim that social liberalism will will solve the the misery of our lives because they can't name the real cause anymore. Nobody can name the thing nobody can name the thing we can only pretend to have a cultural response to it that could make the difference it's all snake oil. The thing is some people are aware they're smelling snake oil and some people don't know they're selling snake oil. That's the real difference that was the fight in the Republican Party. The internationalist knew they were selling snake oil. The local producers thought it was real stuff that it really cures your ails that's the best the difference within these parties because the the real question can't be answered because we need to run a huge trade deficit to keep this thing this this.

[17:04](https://youtu.be/OQsp7ZtFxOM?t=17m04s)

That's technically true right now. It's just describing events as long as the dollar as a reserve currency because we need to build the military because we're the cops. We're we're the head of the octopus and we need to have where we direct the military arm. The police arm so we have to have be able to run huge deficits and we also have to have a population that can buy things because we're the consumer of last resort. So we have to. We can't do it. We can't stop spending or or tax it or I mean. We can't stop spending money on the military and we can't stop with spending money directly or indirectly through quantitative easing and through government programs putting money into people's hands so that and credit into people's hands so that they can keep buying credit being the important thing like the it's all just credit to keep the system going and so social liberals. I have the have the the cultural position and social position and due to their wealth due to their their holding onto that fragment of work middle of middle-class wealth that we're still hanging on to that's slowly shrinking. This iceberg of post-war wealth that went to the middle the white middle class mainly and is now slowly shrinking and people still holding on to some and the people holding on to more are the Liberals and so they have the they because because they have institutions like colleges that sort of launder. Their continued exist at the top their continued role in exploiting right like their exploiters and they know it and you go to college to sort of soothe yourself of feeling bad about it and that leaves you coming out of the end liberal. Socially you don't go to college here on the bottom if you're being exploited well.

Then you don't have really a lot of guilt to sue in the first place and then you don't go through the process and so you are more likely to blame cultural elements especially if there's a party that exists to convince you that there are cultural explanations for this and that blame other people for things because you're trying to blame somebody for your for why you're mad. The liberal isn't trying to blame anybody. Liberal is trying to assuage guilt. Those are the two poles of motivation for politics. Liberal wants does not feel guilty. The conservative wants to blame somebody and so the Republicans are there to have scapegoats at a cultural level for them to go to and that's why they gravitate towards their liberals want.

They want to feel virtuous and therefore going for the underdog makes them feel better and it makes them feel like they deserve their wealth now and what happened with the Republican Party is Pearlstein. Points out is that as economics fell away as the thing you could actually talk about when you're running for anything and got filled with culture that meant that the party itself filled with people who cared about culture because the people who care about culture they're producing people who don't have that old understanding. They don't understand that these things are just to write to rile up the rubes. They don't understand that this is supposed to be rhetoric because they're learning they're sleeping the same culture that everyone else is now absorbing that all emanates from the alienation caused by the industrialization cutting off growth for the American working class and so over time the party itself becomes taken over.

By those people. The true believers and now what we see with Trump is this that like his war with the deep state is a war with the now totally triumphant lumpin reactionary. Hicks basically over the remaining shell of establishment Republicans who understand that they're in a global system. We are in a global system you dumb. Hicks we can't bring the jobs back. You have to give people bread and circuses what are you doing but guys like Trump and the specific and the people who follow Trump - one way or another. They don't understand that they think that like the capitalism is discrete economies and then America needs to compete against the other discrete. Economies not that capitalism is monopolizing and totalizing and that there is no separating these there's no separating us from China. There's no separating us from Europe or Mexico or anybody else.

There's only facilitating the flow but because we don't talk about that to people and no actual conservative. Voters think that's what's going on. They think we're in a battle between states. They vote for people who also believe that and now they run everything and they're in a civil war with the remaining institutional memory of the bureaucrats who are more connected to the data and less connected to the ideology than anybody in the system still knows to be necessary and that's why Trump got in there and he immediately folded on everything because that establishment bit back but now over time we're seeing that the pressure is mounting because that's the center of gravity of the Republican Party and like that's the kind of thing that you kind of hoped could have happened in Reverse with Bernie. He gets in there and you've got the true believers but now you know the idea of being now. It's believing that that scene through their lie as opposed to the Republicans who are just taking seriously the propaganda of the up of the you know the upper ranks and that's because at the base the Democratic Party could theoretically make a solitary and anti-capitalist argument which is impossible for the current Republican Party.

To do consider capitalism is embedded in DNA. The argument the debate between the populace and the establishment is just what that means it's a it's a it's an information question. It's not ideological and I would say that the establishment ones no understand the nature of capitalism more than the Nationalists and the populace. So they're dumber technically even if they don't like capitalism and that's good. They really think no it's just this type of capitalism and that we can get a good capitalism which we whiten it up. They have less information or they're dumber and it's a combination of both and they reinforce each other they're dumber conservatives than the establishment ones who understand that this is a global system and you know may have to manage flow and that means cultural change is gonna happen and you have to defuse it by by giving cultural grievance a a vent whoo all right I hope that made sense I was thinking about that all day and I was like. This is gonna be a little abstract and I and there's gonna be a lot of threads. I hope it made sense so anyway. That's why that's a good book and that's also why the liberal culture war can never be the place where anything will be won. It's impossible. It is a busy box.

It is an Oregon accumulator for all the political alienation that should be channeled towards building institutions of resistance to capitalism. You're just putting all yours usance engineer. You're filling it up. You're nothing into this thing every day and all of your political anima goes out of it and then you just have a sandwich. You go to bed so yeah stop stop putting or go and stop getting the Oregon keep your Oregon to yourself you. Sometimes you get an overflow and you got it. You got to like relieve the pressure from the tire and I I understand I do it. I have to do it. I mean I have to do it for the job but also I have to do it for myself. But I try to do it less and less I tried to wean myself.

Like today I tried to start talking big picture and then I ended up talking back once again but the thing is I'm not even talking here about political talking here about the Internet. I mean I'm sorry but the social issues the social. The culture war cannot be a plus a plate that doesn't just mean on the Internet. It means anywhere it can't be a productive place and I think you'll find anyone who says but what about XY and Z what they're talking about is the potential for those things to be wedded to a a socialist project that you're talking about breaking open a consensus that is now open for capture and it frees. Free is this free flowing and it's a question of how to exploit that how to use that energy the most beneficial. But that is always with in mind the knowledge that it cannot be the endpoint of struggle because then you end up going from tearing down one statue to trying to tear down a bigger statue and just finding more emotionally satisfying realms of symbolic action. Somebody asks how did materialism and Buddhism go together in my mind. It comes down to this. Buddhism is a base to me and you can say I'm wrong but it works for me and that's what matters to me and no one else can check my work because there is no great and test-taker in the sky sorry. It's just an acknowledgement of the unity of everything at very very fundamental basis.

The idea that the universe is one thing. Eternally we are all connected we are all the same stuff to the point that our assumption of separateness is a delusion. I think that's it and then the next thing is. The next recognition is okay so separateness is an illusion but it still is one that that persists because of our accumulated experience of it. You know like. It's. It's like echolocation. We build a world around us that becomes real and to separate it. That's how we that's how consciousness is formed out of the void and then it's right. It's that that is thinking that it's a void and not that it's just more of the same stuff and I think materialism is the analysis of how that illusory but still existent material world operates. It's like okay there's separateness and illusion but look through this. This dimension. This this the shaft of light. It shapes up to look like something how does that something operate like how it's it's describing the waves like if you imagine the universe is a giant ball of water with waves rippling back and forth throughout it. Materialism is describing how they how they came to be and how they are bounce bouncing off of each other and how they will bounce off of each other in the future. And I think that dialectical the grinding of opposites of objective to subjective momentum and position. I think that's what generates the form the material. The material illusion makes takes all right that was good. I felt good so let's take some questions cuz that was pretty heavy.

Let's get silly with it. If anyone has like some fun history counterfactuals or or f marry kill things or just you know how many ducks. I can fight a knife to take a nice low wind out. I grilled yeah. I grilled a couple times last week. I did birds and and Glee's as we now have to call them as now in my head. I can't call anything else. I heard it like two weeks ago and now it's instinctive. That's how culture works so insidious but of course. I'll probably forget it. In another week. It holds you tight and then let you go. I'm gonna try to smoke some pork in fact guys this is a good chance for me to announce this so tomorrow. If things go well. I might cancel it cancel it. I'm gonna try to smoke a pork but tomorrow. I'm gonna you know put some stuff on. It put some rub on. I'm gonna get one of those low and smoke things going it's good I'm gonna do it. It's only got two pounds of two pounds of pork shoulder so probably like five hours five six hours. I'm gonna make a hoisin sauce that someone gave me a recipe for but I'll have backup if it doesn't work and I'm hoping to stream at some pro during the process. So you can like take a look at what it how it's looking and watch me. Maybe spritz it down with some with some vinegar solution. So if everything goes well I'll have that. But I'm gonna have backup probably just some steaks or something. In case it. It goes to okay so you don't want to. I don't want to don't. I'll leave everybody empty-handed after they come for a grill. But I do have a meat thermometer. So I know I'm not gonna kill anybody.

Apparently. I had one the entire time I didn't even know I did I found it on top of the refrigerator so we're good. I look the mossad up that weird-ass poster that that Cuomo made someone Ursula Lawrence is a Twitter shout-out. She pointed out to me that it looks very much like one of the paintings that hardwood flipped Fritz merrill made of like the the symbolic alchemical paintings that explain the the nature of the universe and how to pierce its mystery. He he it looks very alchemical. It looks very very much like an esoteric shark. It looks like one of those things that you find in a book of errata from like a famous schizophrenic intellectual. One of those like Henry Darger guys who leaves a tiny apartment filled with scrawls that end up getting published by soft skull press and there it is in the back oh yes the the the consciousness-raising arch. This is this is the cowbell of eternity. Here it was really cool or like yeah like a medieval text like a medieval. A medieval drawing of like the Kingdom of Heaven or or illustration from it looks like if you turn it upside down.

It could have been Dante's 9 rings whoa what if what if you put like a black light on it or something or put like put a candle behind it. And it just becomes that I'd be pretty funny god damn it. I'm so mad I'm so disappointed that logic authority 9 is not gonna get another season. They had said they were setting up such good stuff and you know that it wasn't gonna be a thing where oh it's gonna lose its momentum. They had I guarantee you they had like a season. The number they said it a season number in advance like I would guess like 4 or 5 probably would have tied it up damn. It shouldn't have made a deal unless they could have sworn to get him at least three seasons because I think you can do ok with three but two is especially when you got such a great mystery in the background. All the stuff with Orbis and the parabola group and of course duds dad who 100% is not dead like 0% chance that their father is dead. The Dudley the Dudley clans dad no way he will come back. He would come back for sure third season although I think it could have been a fun twist if dad finds out that he finds evidence that his dad's alive and of course Liz doesn't believe him and he follows the trail and finds out that yeah. His dad did faked his own death but then he had died subsequently. I think that'd be kind of funny and like fit with the themes of the show but yeah and I'm assuming that the parabola group invented Bitcoin like that seems to be pretty clear that that's gonna happen I would like to know more. I would like to know more I'm clicking on that and they won't give it to me. Lizard man has no taste that he won't pick up. Put the show back put the show on.

[34:35](https://youtu.be/OQsp7ZtFxOM?t=34m35s)

Prime I had to live in Europe where would I live problem. Maybe people's Berlin was it but really is. It's it's cliche to say. But it's very nice Ireland too but realistically Iceland in a compound geothermal heat. Hydroponic agriculture. Interlocking fields of fire across absolutely empty lava flows until the volcano inside goes off and kills you you'd be. You could survive any disaster scenario. The Netherlands is nice too. I have to say I'm very charming.

Where is the best possibility for a leftist Marxist movement. You know what I kind of think. It's people. I've talked to people who made this argument and I think they have something. I think it's the Chinese working class because they are the people who hold the condition closest to traditional Marxist notions of class consciousness formation densely packed urban factory workers. Those that's who built socialism in this in the Europe now of course because of cultural difference and time difference and Technology difference. It doesn't mean. It's gonna work this time along the same axis because Marx was figuring a certain cultural context now manufacturing of consent and alienating people from their class consciousness and from their very spirit being have elevated surveillance technology propaganda. We've created an entire virtual virtual dimension where people can dump all of their energy and discontent into that something. Marx literally couldn't have imagined so that means we're not in the same situation but those people are the closest we've got and so if there is anything to that notion of this is the friction that creates the fire they've got the best kindling and that's why I think the dream the dream scenario even in the catastrophe. The rolling catastrophe that now is going to be the 21st century there's no way out of it. It's going to be at the catastrophe century. I mean we're already starting. We're here. It's if this is normals. Over. This is the new normal until the new normal shows up and it's all going to be bad but the one where there's recovery towards recovery away from this critical failure.

This critical over emphasis on capitalism criminal overconsumption towards some sort of stable. A world system of sort of positive feedback loop of socialism where we're a consumption is distributed southward and transformed into efficiency and then that efficiency is just like a a the same kind of concept of a flow that exists in our capitalism in a world system but positively towards I hate to use the word but healing way from exploitation towards cooperation. So that's if that's gonna happen. I think it's gonna happen in some sort of union between China and in the United States on the terms laid out by the negotiators who would be in the good scenario the working class just in some way like working or in America in the United States like working class plus progressive booyah instead of being led by just this rump social liberal nothing else current bushwa that we have now against the Chinese like a renewed Chinese working class now the Chinese working class. One of the things they have to fight against is that the government that there or would they would have to organize against calls itself communist so they're gonna have a harder time than previous generations of alienated workers putting a name to their alienation because parsh part of the descriptive architecture that would have got them to class. Consciousness is going to be tarnished and alienated from so that's one of the more. There are many reasons that we're on a run of bad trajectory and and any good outcome is not in any way to be assumed but anything could happen still and of course the bad. The bad version of that is a corporate merger carried out between the billionaire captured Chinese Communist Party and our bushwa dictatorship parties representing capital just handshaking across the Bering Strait and then that then we get then that then we get then we do get the net Matt Stoller nightmare where Chinese social control gets imported entirely to the United States that is what would happen so Stoller's stories.

Nightmare is absolutely a possibility but his where he gets it. Wrong is because he's a libertarian because he does not. He hates the concept of dialectical reasoning. He's like almost a pure liberal. In his thinking. He thinks the way to defeat to stop that is by having conflict with China meaning heightening conflict between our perspective working classes yeah. That's a great idea dumbass how that work in World War one how did the problem of the Rhee. The real threat to like democratic institutions in Western Europe to like Kaiser right so apps like monarchism like the central powers. Like the the don't you think they're. I mean. Obviously a lot of it was propaganda but there was a genuine concern among like the leftists who ended up supporting the war credits in their respective countries and it broke open and you're gonna use use. Those same principles those same principles of xenophobia and nationalism that mystify and obfuscate the class conflict that we have to instead create you're only going to lead to the worst outcome where they just blow each other up and then we have a new Dark Age where emerging from the rubble of our global capitalist Empire is a neo feudal technocratic archipelago of remaining stakeholders. Your.

Bezos's your Zuckerberg your cokes your Oprah's all of them now using their technology. The remnant technology that they have disproportionate access to to command a neo feudal economy of direct service and all those beautiful liberal institutions and even communist dreams of social equality fall into the dustbin of history for another millennium. So good luck with that Stoller you dumb. The way to defeat that danger of the corporate takeover the merger happening that you pretend to think as a takeover because you don't understand that there it's this. It's two hands and the same thing the way to defeat that is to establish working-class solidarity and functionality through the institutions. Hopefully rising labor militancy. Like I said big-box retail is a huge site of struggle there and and party some sort of Workers Party. Maybe I don't know I've been I've been thinking more and more about the need for that.

I wouldn't have said that before the burning thing but like and I don't think we were wrong to do it. I think it was necessary. It was like you needed to be disenchanted of that as option and there was no way to wish that away it had to happen but now I'm wondering. If that's a necessity I don't know for sure because you know you know. It's all about the response and we're gonna about see some massive shocks coming up to people in terms of the level of exploitation and alienation that they're gonna be asked to suffer. They're gonna have to alienate themselves from their own their own life. They're gonna be told that they're gonna have to voluntarily risk their life. More than they already are consciously anyway in order to keep doing things that they don't even want to do. I mean my god can you imagine the turbocharging of alienation where it's like hey you know that job. You don't even like and you do technically risk every day you're gonna get by hit by a car or. Shot by somebody while you're there or whatever to add to that. We're gonna add the conscious knowledge that there's a contagious disease out there that could any moment get you and kill you or even worse and more likely may have you give it to an older family member and then they get sick and then you get to make that risk you have to take that risk of your own volition. You have to internalize that that's what that's the wage slavery concept. That's why wage slavery is in many ways more insidious psychologically even than chattel slavery because you internalize it even greater you are the one doing this. You're the one who went to work you're the one who got your grandma sick. You're the one who as they cut off your leg oh. I deserve this in a way that it's unique and it's horrifying and that's gonna go somewhere.

That's all I'm saying that's alien nations going somewhere and there's very little organizational bottle. There's a very little relational infrastructure to catch any of it like it. So it's gonna be a raging torrent and we need to have like a couple of guys hats and like a bucket. There's no there's no like conduit you know. It's people just everybody bailing with their hand with their hats. As this raging torrent. There's like all the thought leaders and all of like the strategists and all the politicians are just trying to grab. The bucket loads we could be building an actual conduit to catch it and direct it and I think like some of that is being done.

But we're too early in it to know what parts are gonna be durable and I think that honestly I think that this election is going to be a massively important. Not the results necessarily but how the parties respond to the crisis that's going to be perpetuating itself. That's why I can't be very optimistic. But I also cannot go black pill in any way because I don't have enough confidence in my ability to predict the future to say that I know what the is gonna go on here and I don't trust anyone who claims that they do because I'm sorry. We're all we all have that dunning-kruger effect somewhere in us because you cannot fully know your own biases and you can't know things you don't know you can't know you. You can't always know that there are things you don't know. As Donald Rumsfeld said and he was right like that the thing he said was very accurate but it's just he was just saying it to cover his ass but some of us. It's too late. I think you can say pretty definitively.

It's too late to prevent a century of catastrophes but there are degrees of catastrophe. You know like the crisis of the third century is different than you know. The Justinian plague is different than like the Mongol invasions of you know. Like there are periods of dislocation and and warfare you know but like all right what about compare like Ireland in the 70s. The troubles like you could say that that was a period of prolonged social crisis was a lot of misery compare that to I don't know Persia during the during the Mongol invasion you know the thing where they wiped out maybe 90% of the population. There are degrees here and they could be. They could be shaped only in the moment that they occur because the conditions obtained then and they don't obtain now and we can only prepare. You can only prepare ourselves Christopher Hill. Someone asked about Christopher Hill as the Marxist historian yeah. He's really good.

He wrote a book about that I read about Oliver Cromwell as like a you know proto bushwa figure really good yes Ellen Ellen metal skins. Wood is also very good and of course Hobbs Bob if you want to do European history 19th 20th century European history. You gotta go with Hobbes Bob. You're gonna come in here and you're gonna be quoting Hobbes Bob on me age of extremes. Yeah CLR James also very good come on Cedric Robinson excellent yeah. These guys got it all covered everyone they're saying it's pretty. Good I wouldn't call Tony Judt a Marxist but he's he has a very good handle on the shifting political economy of Europe. Ooh somebody asks a very interesting counterfactual. I was actually talking to Brendan about this the other day counter of fact. I think one of the think it'd be fun to you could do kind of an experiment with counterfactuals where most of the big ones that people talk about you can reason out in your head. How oh it wouldn't change things how much because at the end of the day events individual events cannot. They have a spot. They have a butterfly effect okay and they create a pattern of randomness but individual discrete events for the most part can't shift things if there isn't the necessary conditions for them to take the cultural conditions.

If they're not there that it will be overwhelmed by the flow just the stultifying reality of the existing institutions but the ones that are really interesting then the counterfactuals are very interesting are the ones where you have more of a fluid situation and the henry wallace nomination is one of those things were that could have actually very easily happened and if it had in the fluid moment of post-world War two when you had like the I mean the Democratic Party had gone from being like a Twilight Struggle. At the beginning of the of FDR's administration. The the the Democratic Party started out in a war between East Coast progressive types neo progressives and southern reactionaries and that was and that battle was demonstrated by the ticket FDR eastern elite liberal whose New York governorship had been a laboratory of New Deal stuff that would become a new policies and John Nance Garner of Texas a old-school southern Democrat and everything that presented pork ball pork barrel politics plus good old-fashioned white supremacy and also isolationist politics because of that narrow-minded focus of local conservativism I told you about and by the end of the administration it was sort of a civil war at least before a Truman got in. There it was a civil war between the East Coast elites guys and communists actual communists who were representing ended up being represented in the people who ran the Henry Wallace campaign for the third-party campaign in 1948 which wouldn't be necessary if by just a few quirks of history.

He'd ended up being vice president when FDR died which absolutely could have happened and that's like yeah. Of course. We don't have an institution we don't have we don't have anything like the institutions to accept communist rule in America and I would say no not out front not outwardly. But I think you had enough genuine left-wing. Mobile internally mobilized organizational energy within the government and within the labor movement that you could have had the kind of a genuine entry ISM but Truman being president really helped slam the door on that really slam the door on that and you imagine like he dies. Maybe he dies before FDR because before before the end of the third term hard to imagine him losing re-election in 44 before there had been any chance for conservativism to pick up the pieces and start you know assembly assembling the the the cultural because at that point culture was still saying that the Soviets were the good guys and it had to because it was so the war was on and was only after the war was over that we were able to have that cultural that Mighty Wurlitzer of consent manufacturing turned against communism and against the Russians so there wouldn't have been cultural antibodies to fight it off. It's hard to think I don't know it's such a big change that it's hard to really think how it could have actually played out. I mean a lot of people say it would have prevented the Cold War and I think that I mean since since the Cold War was almost entirely imposed by the United States on a isolationist looking Soviet Union that had no real interest in brinksmanship which they proved in rounded up and massacred by the monarchists in the British. That was where the split from you Tito happen is because Tito was like what the it ain't checkers that was basically Stalin and Tito. This is a good question.

Matt Trump or Biden will leave less blood on your hands guess what it doesn't matter. I don't think this has been emphasized enough. We all people like to say what difference does it make when you vote in a swing state I would argue that from a metaphysical perspective no vote anywhere matters no individual vote anywhere matters. It's the principle of the Avalanche and the the snowflake. It is a it is a moral. The results of an election are a moral avalanche. The crash on upon all of us. An individual vote is an individual snowflake that lands on your finger. Morally. It's like it's barely anything and so I think people really should more embrace that idea not don't vote but don't put anything behind your vote. Not don't certainly don't put anything psychically important and the reason that's important is because that's where the whole argument against an electoral ism holds sway. It's not necessarily that oh you know that there's some choice between elections and grassroots activism. It's that elections if they are pursued with passion do divert because they take away your energy. You commit yourself psychically to voting as a principle and then you do things like volunteer for a candidate or go online and argue about which candidate you support and that leaves you with less mana less anima. Less juice songs less orgone to direct towards a different campaign that doesn't mean don't vote. It means know that you're just going in there and voting and the thing is is the more stuff you do in your real life about your politics.

The more organizing you do with your labor with like trying to form a union or trying to help the Union you have or organizing for a union or organizing protests organizing tenants or associations organizing any kind of any kind of connective tissue building any social repair and he's repairing of the social net you're gonna find that you're not going to not want to vote. Maybe you like voting I like voting but you're not going to think about it that much and you're gonna go in there and press the button you're gonna leave because you're connected people who sweat over their vote and turn it into a talisman turning in to the soul defining feature of their worth as a person Trump voter Obama I voted for Obama these things meaning anything that isn't because it's the only political action you carry out so it has to have all the meaning attached to it. So it doesn't matter who you vote for anywhere. I'll probably write it in Bernie but once I'm in. There all bets are off because it's it's blowing away an eyelash if you feel like you're contributing politically somewhere else because it will feel fake if you just if you just say I'm voting doesn't matter but you don't do anything else you're still posting online. All the time about Biden guess what buddy you don't actually think that if you actually thought that you'd be doing something else see I got people in my in my freaking men.

She's making an argument for a person. It doesn't matter its tears in the rain. It doesn't matter right in snuffleupagus. I wrote didn't drill in 2016. Maybe I'll do it again. I'm just gonna vote for the Harper's letter. That's gonna be who I'm gonna vote for. Just write it in right there yeah alright in Matthew Iglesias.

There you go a guy I I mean I don't hate him anymore. I just pity him. I really pity him and I realize why it's because I realized why he's so loathsome in such a toad boy. It's because he's miserable every moment of his life because everyone in his life is essentially his coworker. His Coast stakeholder he does not have friends everyone. He has all have all of everyone he knows in his life is essentially a co-worker. They're all in this big coffee room together and they're all coworkers and that's why a lot of these media people are liberal because they don't have friends. They only have co-workers and we have colleagues the most bloodless reptilian word imaginable colleagues and what that means that you can never be really ever comfortable around them because you know that at the end of the day there's stranger and that means that they're gonna put their interests above yours with a friend you know that no matter what you do there's gonna be self-interest. You know with anyone but there's also gonna be concern for you and there's people gonna be willing to sacrifice for you and that's I think that's why I pity him is because I realized oh like I don't really have. I don't have colleagues. I mean I don't want to sound like Dom Toretto too much here. But I don't got colleagues. I don't got co-workers.

I got family and I think it's because the different models we live in. Like we are like I said we're pre-capitalist artisans podcasters who are directly paid for by their listeners our artisans as I've said so we have the relationship of artisans like not are not artisan apprentice guys to get like guild members together like in a set like one of those really solid guilds where they like get hammered every night and they you know lead a procession through the town and throw a feast and then dedicate a dedicate like tours at the Cathedral and like run for Town Council and become burgers the dudes guild exactly so we are friends in our Lycan family in that way but because Iglesias has it race the pursuit like he ran towards establishment he ran towards establishment validation just like a lemming like just barreling across the tundra. I spin pinpointed just pinned out dedicated and now he's here congratulations you won the media game and what is media. In the 21st century. It is going online and selling yourself and selling your takes and in a giant online office with everybody where everybody it.

All conversation is conducted over the water cooler. That's it and so all of those HR rules and all of that enforced alienation from each other that caught the culture that makes office life amenable to socialism and amenable to socialist radicalism and radical and organizing because every ritual of it is alienating and one of the big ones is. You can't really lever let your guard down because somebody will cut your. Shareholders to to answer to I don't have Vox shareholders to answer to. I don't have Coast stakeholder Ezra Klein to answer to. I don't have to go out see like a deliverables conference over this and so I I don't have to. I don't have to feel anxious when I'm actually interacting with my friends who are my colleagues technically but like I said like guild member guild members.

[61:00](https://youtu.be/OQsp7ZtFxOM?t=61m00s)

So that's why I can't I used to hate iglesias absolutely oh god. When I was like a takes I was an impotent cloudless. Take Smith I hated him but now that I've like kind of become his peer in media. Anyway. You know in terms of someone who's like on a certain platform in the discourse and taken. Like the other path I can look across the chasm and all I have to I can only pity him but I hated him when I was more frustrated. When I wanted what he had I hated him but now that I know that that would have been a poisoned chalice. I can't hate him anymore yeah. I would love to get Guild's back but not like not it not as labour exploitation vehicles is what they became of course. You know the way they exploited apprentices and and limited labor pool limited access. I know I'm sure I try to not hate anybody anymore. I know I get I kind of like head up about people being willfully obtuse. You know I'll still yell from time to time because it's instinctive. But I can't hate the people anymore.

Certainly the media people because none of them individually are even really doing anything bad enough to warrant a real moral reckoning you know. It's the snowflakes in the or avalanche thing again. You can't. It's more. It's more morally weighty than voting. But it's not that much you're still just grinding out takes in the take mill. How bad could you be you know and that doesn't go for that and of course that that that level of of empathy is then not as much that you would extend to somebody in say Judith Miller's position you know or somebody who actively produced propaganda that had adverse effects in the real world and then you know political leaders get even less business leaders get even less but there has to be a baseline everything for everybody all right one more question. Then I'm writing it up even lizards like Bezos. I mean the whole lizard thesis is that you become less human as you become more powerful and I think that's true you you armor yourself against your fellow people. You arm you delude yourself further and further into believing that you are an isolated consciousness and that you're not part of any greater being and that's a delusion you're driving yourself. Insane. You're turning yourself into a lizard and you're sandblasting your own half of your brain's ability to perceive the world because these things are perceptible.

These things the connection is not isn't. It doesn't it's not entirely built intellectually that comes after it becomes. It comes after you are overwhelmed by the by the experience of oneness with others and he's never felt that and if he has he fights it off ferociously and that makes him miserable and that's where the empathy comes in because I know that Bezos is miserable I mean he might still be deluding himself into thinking that he's gonna inject his body to a robot. But like one of these days the whole thing's gonna fall apart even if it's a hundred years from now and then he will die and go to hell not in terms of actually burning in her soul or anything. But his last moments will stretch into an endless agony. Anyway spreading love guys spread love bye-bye.
