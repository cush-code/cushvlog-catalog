ðŸŽ¥ The speaker discusses disappointment with a movie trailer, childhood memories of comedy shows, and the evolution of sketch comedy.

ðŸ“º The speaker prefers traditional sketch shows like Kids in the Hall and criticizes the decline in quality of SNL and The Simpsons over time.

ðŸŽ­ Capitalism leads to the decline of once great shows like The Simpsons and SNL, while the impact of politics on comedy and personal biases make it difficult to accurately judge the quality of comedy over time.

ðŸŽ­ SNL's political cold opens, lack of memorable characters, and Keenan Thompson's contentment with his career are discussed, along with the success of shows and movies being based on viewership rather than quality.

ðŸŽ­ SNL sketches lack originality and innovation due to being written by the same college-educated individuals, resulting in regurgitated experiences and political self-conception.

ðŸŽ­ Gatekeepers limit creativity in entertainment, capitalism drives a simulated world, and the goal of progress should be to turn work into art and play.

ðŸ“º Prestige television shows rely on viewer engagement and commercial success, with media response shaping their success and targeting rich, college-educated urban liberals, leaving a disconnect between those with and without money.

ðŸ”® The warlocks are now the antichrist, ruling and causing misery, while Trump's entry into politics was spurred by Obama's mockery, with hope for a new political synthesis.
