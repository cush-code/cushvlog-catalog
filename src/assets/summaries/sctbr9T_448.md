🌍 Political engagement and building character are important, but finding meaning outside of electoral politics and connecting with trusted people is more effective, as society operates like the matrix and the tension surrounding the election will mutate into something else.

📺 The speaker discusses the emotional shift post-election, worries about increased racism, and anticipates a return to lighthearted programming, while also noting the decline in entertainment quality and increase in political content.

🎨 American cuisines stretch meat to make more food, politics is experienced as an aesthetic, consumer economy targets college-educated people, art and content exist on a spectrum, and the speaker may log off early.

📰 Trump convinces his supporters the election was stolen, but his presidency is characterized by reliance on Twitter and disregard for actual power, while reactionary people with power use violence against the population.

📰 Republicans have majority in judiciary and state legislatures, making it difficult for Democrats to wield power, with no personal incentive to impeach Trump and potential for prolonged political tension if he loses.

📰 Trump losing the election will shift QAnon towards a more hostile direction, the congresswoman's influence will change the average congressman, and the entertainment value of Trump will wane once he's no longer president.

🤔 Custer was a mercenary acting on behalf of railroad interests, provoking war with the Sioux and not a good guy.
