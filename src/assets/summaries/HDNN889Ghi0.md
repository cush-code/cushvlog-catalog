🎤 American hegemony and the war on terror were attempts to solidify US military domination, but rising powers are now challenging it, leading to potential cultural and political implications of power transfer to China and the possibility of proxy wars.

🌍 The US is unlikely to engage in a proxy war with China, as both countries are on a trajectory towards armed conflict due to their integrated economies and political systems, driven by a capitalist death drive and resulting in a dysfunctional and collapsing society.

🔥 The GOP's war with China is driven by a need to ascribe America's problems to an outside boogeyman, leading to a desire for military conflict and a psychological identification with America as a powerful force, while Democrats focus on Russia and the subconscious fear of climate change is being sublimated into a drive for war with China.

🌍 Putin's view of Ukraine led to war, US sabotaged peace efforts, Russia is struggling, China is rising, and there's potential for conflict in Ukraine and Taiwan.

🌍 The stability of the United States will determine the outcome of China's potential integration of Taiwan, and the US may intentionally precipitate a crisis rather than respond to a unilateral Chinese invasion, while capitalism is evolving and the US is facing backlash for its actions with central banks and the IRA.

🔥 The turn towards new atheism in the early 21st century deepened America's religious insanity, leading to a belief in pure rationality as the only revealer of truth and ultimately resulting in the destruction of the planet.

🚀 The USS England and USS Stennis were involved in military operations, and the National Security Act of 1947 had significant implications for American imperialism.
