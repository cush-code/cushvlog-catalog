📝 The speaker discusses social conflicts and emerging social order in the southern states after the Civil War, the overwhelming Democratic voting of the black American population, and the idea of an alternative reconstruction for social solidarity.

📺 Blaming past and present racists lets us off the hook from our obligations to each other as humans, our past contains only patterns and stories that leave room for change, and the civil war was a bourgeois revolution that led to the overthrow of the planter elite by small holders and the emergent urban merchant class.

📝 The liberal orthodoxy in the Republican party hindered recognition of the implications of the Civil War, former slaves asserted their rights and independence, and the market's invisible hand creates a coercive relationship for black women and children to work.

📜 Capitalism thrives on social misery, demand for land ownership by black Americans is a fundamental expression of liberty, former slaves were exploited by northern do-gooders, and reconstruction saw the black population asserting itself through political organization and demands for rights.

📜 Lincoln's approach to reconstruction would have been different from Johnson's, as he would have taken a punitive approach to dealing with former slave owners, and the political structure needs to be flexible enough to accommodate subaltern demands.

🎥 The speaker talks about watching Curtis Dock and the underrated Yahoo season of Community, as well as their experience with Civil War movies and the absurdity of using reenactors for battle scenes.

📝 Carter's post-presidential career was commendable but he didn't change the underlying economic engine, leading to bad politics and being overshadowed by Reagan's tax cuts, showing the shift in progressive ideology and the most humane way to organize capitalism.

🎥 The speaker discusses the history of St. Louis and English civilization, colonial domination, capitalism, and the need for empires to be held accountable for their crimes.
