🍔 The speaker discusses new flavors, the debate fly incident, charity commentary, lack of pandemic awareness, refusal to wear masks, and criticism of FBI involvement in the attempted kidnapping of the governor of Michigan.

🍔 Many people are reluctantly voting for Biden out of fear of a potential Trump-inspired purge, but it's not necessary to justify your vote, and the speaker discusses the underlying conditions that break social obligations and the need to build resistance.

🍔 Birth of a Nation and Top Gun didn't cause rise of KKK, political movements based on symbolic outcomes won't affect material conditions; modern politics is a personal branding exercise, speaker criticizes yippies and new left, believes anarchism reinforces negative patterns in leftist organizing.

🍔 Pence looked sick at the debate, Democrats pushing for 25th amendment, Trump refusing stimulus, lack of concern for human life, potential for right-wing populism, need for disruption of two-party system.

🍔 Trump doesn't do illegal drugs, wants to delay debate due to illness, fears appearing vulnerable, and believes America is not a democracy; old school paleo conservativism is resurging, arguing that democracy is ruled by the mob and the wrong people are in charge due to privilege and incompetence.

🍔 Adam Sandler's new Netflix movie references his old films, America's ideology is based on maintaining power structures, Trump era negatively impacts art, and the speaker didn't like the first episode of the John Brown show.

🍔 Republican governors considering seceding from the country is likely just a ploy for attention, while the Republican party is becoming a rump of wildly reactionary old people consumed by conspiracy, leading to a fracture in the democratic party and the founders' original vision of a government without parties has been replaced by polarized political parties.

🍔 Rank choice voting is not a guaranteed solution, Brexit and British politics are a mess, Trump might still win, and conflicting information online is like being gaslit.
