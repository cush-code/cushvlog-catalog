📅 The boys are opening for a fall tour, tomorrow's discussion will cover "The Black Jacobins," and the loss of autonomy in society has led to a crisis in American social fabric.

🌍 Taking responsibility for our actions is crucial, as the system removes individual responsibility and capitalism impacts individuals, leading to a search for meaning and the need to harmonize feelings with words in times of crisis.

📝 Society based on individual desire will dissolve unless desires are tethered towards building something beneficial, leading to a post-scarcity society with minimal human labor and a return to a pre-historic system of mutual consent and cultural censorship.

📺 Human action can exist outside of market forces, Cuba's survival after the fall of the Soviet Union proves the resilience of its communist system, and the potential for socialist social democracy in Cuba and Vietnam.

🌍 Commit to spiritual connection and meaningful action to drive away catastrophe, Cuba must resist outside influence, leftists have fundamental disagreements, US constitution was designed for aristocratic rule, post-WWII small business ownership meant some independence.

📺 The speaker discusses the constitution, Marxism, and the impact of America's nationalist movement on class rule and systemic inequality.

🌟 Labor struggle and self-interest must lead to meaningful action in our lives, treating political media as entertainment and joining unions for meaningful change, while understanding the interconnectedness of the mind and body in decision-making.

😤 I'm not afraid of not making sense, I can't explain myself anymore, it's frustrating.
