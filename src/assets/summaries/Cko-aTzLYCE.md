🎙 Liberals have faith in a system that rewards them but don't want to change it, Bernie shouldn't join the cabinet, cyber sin revival, German communists faced tough choices, Soviet Union's decisions and interplay with capitalist world, and planning to re-read a book for more insight.

📺 Karensky's approach to holding power was to cry and hope for embarrassment, the ruling on Kavanaugh indicates courts will likely rule for Trump in a contested election, polls have been accurate in non-presidential races since 2016, and Republicans may blame Democrats for stealing the election.

📹 The speaker celebrates their 100th vlog, announces an election night show, and expresses a desire for Biden to win.

📺 Biden has a good chance of winning the election, especially if he wins Florida, but if Trump wins, it could be close enough for a contested outcome, and the shift of Latino and black voters towards Trump is due to a transcendent appeal of his political valence that is not solely determined by race.

📺 The border regime is a permanent part of imperial management, successful left immigration policy should focus on helping people stay in their own countries, and dense urban lifestyle is not a panacea for the current horrors of life in the country.

📺 The potential for escalating tensions and military conflict with China, overshadowing non-interventionist paleoconservative strain in Trumpism, and the infiltration of neocons into the Democratic party as a threat, while the two-party system in the US does not represent different agendas.

📰 The Democratic Party's relationship with the working class severed in the 70s, leading to polarization based on cultural beliefs and education, while Trump has accelerated the process of breaking away from the globalist wing of the Republican Party.
