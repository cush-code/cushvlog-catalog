🎵 The speaker accepts their limited brain capacity and desires to listen to more classical music.

🌍 Global capitalism in the 70s led to breakdown of international new deal structure, US synthesized contradictions more effectively, leading to crisis in fascist nationalist states, impacting society with violence and alienation, scapegoating of Jews in Germany and generalized identity in America, New Deal as treaty between US working class and non-capital owning Americans, introduction of American market structures in Europe led to rebuilding of social democratic consensus but contradictions emerged by mid-60s.

🌍 Japanese manufacturing equal to US is causing inflation and potential social violence, the solution is to reform and eventually take over capitalism from within, with the lack of visionary leadership in America and the fundamental alienation between periphery and center at every level.

📉 The inflation crisis in the 50s led to the emergence of the World Bank, which imposed liberalized financial and capital markets on countries, resulting in a shift towards terminal capitalism and the need to keep US dollar inflation lower than other countries.

🌍 The transcendental nature of capitalism and potential for nuclear war depend on the response of the system, with the federal government's project since the 70s being to break labor domestically and abroad, leading to a decline in manufacturing profit and conflict between workers' interests and company profits.

📉 Racial minorities suffer economic disparities, inflation worsened by reactionary economy, government unable to give money directly to workers, leading to class system under pressure and contributing to inflation, Georgism and single tax may be right but avoiding class conflict and democratically administering the current system is a lie.

📉 The rise of price controls and clampdown on labor wages led to the commercialization and de-democratization of the economy, with the US military-industrial state's investment in computer technology leading to government-funded innovations that were used for private gain, ultimately resulting in government intervention and the refiguring of the state to be less democratically accountable.

📺 The speaker discusses the potential outcomes of conflict, the importance of planning and institutional support, and the resistance of those at the bottom of the power distribution.
