📺 Politics is about deciding who suffers and who is rewarded, shaped by early capitalism, American slavery, and the culture of domination, leading to different relationships with capitalism and morality in different regions.

🤔 Living in a world of guilt and indulgence, institutions maintain a moral facade to prevent exploitation, while the ruling class engages in a sterile bourgeois dialectic.

🔍 People's fear of a worse future maintains capitalism, leading to unhappiness, guilt, and a cultural divide, as they blame themselves and others for their discomfort.

📺 Middle-class anxiety fuels consumption of political media, collective voting for spectacle leads to ineffective political structures, and online righteousness hinders accurate engagement with political issues.

📺 Belief in virtuous ideals can lead to indulgent behaviors, Republicans benefit from dying systems, and politics is a battle between two groups related to capital.
