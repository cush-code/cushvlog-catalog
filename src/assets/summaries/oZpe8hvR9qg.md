🎬 The entertainment industry grapples with guilt and exploitation, while American capitalism faces a crisis due to disappearing free real estate and the dissolution of democratic legitimacy.

🗣️ The shift to social media, passive political engagement in the metaverse, and the need for radical politics to dismantle capitalist structures and prevent the rise of fascism.

📺 Accelerationism is the only opportunity for real political movement, liberals fear the Trump imperium, Americans are soft and reactionary, media impacts individual health and relationship with capitalism, global capitalism creates a new division of labor and technology reflects humanity's worst traits.

🌍 Capitalism has led to a focus on short-term pleasure, a destroyed class system, fake equality, and a global financial crisis with irreversible damage to ecosystems.

📈 The ruling class maintains control through U.S. Treasury bonds, leading to economic decline and urban conflict, while college education serves to suborn individuals to the capitalist state.

🏠 China's integration into the American system has led to exploitation of its labor force, while the US relies on consumer credit and a trade deficit for economic stability, leading to the 2008 housing crisis.

🌍 Capitalism's response to economic crises is streamlined but may not address underlying issues, leading to global banking reliance on drug money, diminishing working-class political power, and increasing conflict within capitalist states.
