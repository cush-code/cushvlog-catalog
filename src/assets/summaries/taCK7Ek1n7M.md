📝 Focusing on being present and connected to others can help avoid falling into traps, individual votes and decisions should be taken in context, and arguing about political involvement online without taking action is maintaining a delusion of coherent involvement in the political system.

🗳️ Voting in the current system may not result in direct consequences, but coordinated voting for a specific candidate can make a difference in the unchanged party structure.
