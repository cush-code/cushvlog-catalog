🗣 The speaker discusses the impact of actions on perception, the theory of conservative leaks, morality of leaking documents, and the need for an alternative value system to critique capitalism and hierarchy.

📺 People within the system are influenced by a value system built on exploitation, leading to the need for solidarity to overthrow capitalism and the importance of norms in politics.

🗣️ The speaker emphasizes the importance of faith in fellow citizens, the intensity of online engagement, and the impact of capitalism on the working class.

📺 Belief in connected consciousness justifies actions, capitalism leads to politics of domination and pleasure, need for coordinated reversal of capital flows and challenging Lockean tradition.

📉 The American economy crisis creates a unified business and political front, while the labor movement struggles to address the crisis and push for greater worker control of production.

📉 Liquidity injections and mortgage-backed securities saved the market after crashes, leading to a global financial structure fueled by foreign money and pensions, with a shift from manufacturing to finance and a divide in the labor market.

📈 The shift in manufacturing to low-wage areas increased exploitation, closed off middle-class opportunities for working-class people, and led to the rise of a new professional managerial class organizing along consumer, racial, gender, and demographic lines, while state intervention and financialization intensified social alienation and undermined political effectiveness.

🗣️ The concept of class consciousness is no longer relevant in our post-class reality, so debating who is working class is a waste of time.
