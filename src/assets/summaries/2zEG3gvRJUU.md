🤔 Society should minimize suffering by spreading pleasure broadly, using dialectical materialism to reduce suffering and achieve universal human enlightenment through technology, while acknowledging the inevitability of being wrong.

📺 Enjoying "Better Call Saul" and other prestige TV creates a culture that requires TV to be good, hindering the ability to move away from degradation in personal relationships, preferences, and political beliefs.

🤔 Our culture doesn't encourage existential questions, but we must resolve contradictions to achieve transcendence and push towards the good, reflecting on past mistakes and emphasizing the importance of belief and action.

🤔 Communication divorced from judgment is important, live in accordance with beliefs close to enlightenment, understanding different ideologies is a collaborative effort, and maintaining morality and empathy is crucial.

🗣️ Seek enlightenment and understand the fluidity of identity, prioritize understanding and cooperation in relationships, and strive to better each other despite the dehumanizing conditions of capitalism.
