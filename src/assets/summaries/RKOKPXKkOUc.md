🎙️ The future sucks you, not the other way around, as the speaker discusses upcoming events, business deals, and the book "Ministry of the Future" while addressing the human response to climate change.

🌍 The book discusses the impact of 20 million people dying, the exploitation of the global south by the global north, and the psychological impact of living in a world filled with catastrophe and displacement.

🌍 International cooperation for climate action must consider national social formations, capitalism is being challenged to incorporate externalities, the future holds potential for progressive advancements, India undergoes a political shift, and belief in salvation may involve violence.

🔒 Russians hacked pipeline and food conglomerate, leading to gas shortages and frozen beef supply, while the ruling elite's power is in conflict with the new climate reality and the potential impact of drone technology on security.

📝 The future requires a shift towards technology, economic incentives, and communal existence to address environmental issues and resist corporate control, while also navigating the potential for a religious revival.

🚀 The future will be a luxury space communist bubble sustained by the hyper wealthy through delusion and religious mania, while those who do not believe in science and technology drive the machine of capital towards destructive ends.

🎬 The entertainment industry is exclusive to those with a safety net, local and transnational capital battle is a cultural projection, and our minds have offloaded a huge percentage of our mental and emotional world into the cyber realm.
