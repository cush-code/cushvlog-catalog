🎥 The speaker discusses the impact of 9/11 and viral memes, online "freaks" claim ownership of concepts, and the mythological elements of QAnon.

🎙️ The left's shift towards believing 9/11 was an inside job reflects a deeper awareness of the failure of the left to generate real change and the possibility of an inside job carrying out a massive attack.

🔍 People's motivations for seeking 9/11 truth have shifted, but the speaker's assessment remains the same; high level knowledge of government involvement in 9/11 and anthrax attacks raises questions, politicians are detached from constituents and both parties are not pushing for massive stimulus to maintain control in the service economy.

🗣 Republicans won't realign as a heron volk democracy, Tucker Carlson may not have the name recognition to run independently, Trump's movement lacks a coherent core, and Bannon failed due to lack of intelligence.

📝 Neither Democrats nor Republicans are actively trying to win the election, as individual capitalist firms prioritize short-term interests over cooperation, leading to the need for external forces to regulate the market for the collective best interest of capital.

🚨 The speaker discusses increased police presence on 9/11 and the diminishing fear of terrorism, while questioning the official story and government involvement, and also mentions wanting to try the best pizzas in America.

🍕 The speaker discusses their favorite pizza places, the controversy surrounding pizza, and their disappointment with mediocre pizza, while also sharing their experiences with different types of pizza around the world.

🎥 In an alternate universe, 9/11 never happened and there is a focus on climate amelioration and green technology, with a movie idea involving Seth Rogen and Ben James Franco being better as a Funny or Die sketch.
