📚 The rise of global capitalism and the conflict with American role, the sublimation of the rule of law in global globalization, and the shift from Keynesianism to neoliberalism are discussed.

📝 Capitalism relies on mass home ownership for white workers, leaving no one to advocate for a Keynesian solution, while government and MMT proponents believe in the illusion of money and the necessity of action to democratize institutions.

🌍 Global capitalism creates dislocation through trade treaties, prioritizing private property rights over democracy and favoring capital over regulation, leading to a regulatory regime that consistently favors big multinational conglomerate banks.

🌍 Global capital systems prioritize financial institutions over the people, leading to economic crises and bailouts, with examples including the impact of NAFTA on the Mexican economy and the role of the US in supporting dictators in Indonesia, Congo, and the Philippines.

🌍 Russia's refusal to comply with American demands led to their default on debt, prompting Putin to resist American capitalism, while the new regulatory regime aims to maintain control over a decentralized system and Clinton's approach involved making home ownership accessible through financializing mortgages.

📝 Deregulation in a financialized economy is influenced by sexism and Wall Street, leading to a theological belief in the invisible hand of God and the creation of a "geo hell" in pursuit of heaven.
