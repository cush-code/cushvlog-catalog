🎙 The speaker recounts being kicked out of Noah's Ark, expresses frustration and anger through poetic lyrics, and struggles with microphone setup.

📰 Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan shows his independence from the Democratic party, as he is seen as a puppet, while Obama only withdrew half the troops needed and the media's ignorance of Taliban advancements led to the quick collapse in Afghanistan.

📰 Trump failed to carry out a coup, planned to withdraw from Afghanistan, and was influenced by concerns about looking like a loser, while Biden embraces suffering with the people.

📺 The speaker discusses the impact of resource crisis and ecological conditions on the capitalist system, the failure of systems to adapt, and the emergence of a new exploited class.

🤔 Middle class individuals identify more with capital than with labor, while the working class can collectively hold power and abolish class divisions in a post-scarcity world.

📝 Working-class organized labor unions and parties to challenge nationalist states, forming a class alliance with progressive bourgeois, leading to intensifying capitalist contradictions and the emergence of a revolution in Paris, but ultimately losing the war of the 20th century and resulting in a society defined by class exploitation and political control.

🌍 Climate change threatens weather patterns, labor redistribution was unfeasible in previous civilizations, and a three-way battle between ruling classes is on the horizon.

🌎 America is in decline due to ecological conditions, capitalism has created a global exploited class, and the speaker is disillusioned with the lack of meaning in the world, advocating for a new organizing principle beyond the worker.
