🔍 The speaker discusses their fear of death and its impact on their life, as well as the challenges of the world and the delay in releasing the premium app due to technical issues.

🧠 Life is a constant flux of emotions, with modern religions shaping our unconscious desires and the subjective experience of dying being a reflection on memories and reconciliation.

💀 When we die, our consciousness meets our cultural programming, Buddha and Confucius structured our understanding of living, life consists of different stages, and societal structures dictate our bodily desires, leading to alienation and the inability to relax even in decline.

🔮 When we die, our consciousness experiences eternity, heaven and hell as subjective experiences, ultimately being pulled towards an inexorable black hole and bouncing back and forth between heaven and hell.

🔮 After death, consciousness disperses and reconciles with past experiences, leading to belief in the truth of all religions, and the potential for a future human civilization to align with the speaker's beliefs.

📝 Constant warfare drives scientific advancement, Christianity and socialism predict the end of capitalism, consciousness can align with others, desire is anti-rational, and the Bible is about the Jews adapting to defeat.

👽 Our beliefs shape our experience of life, and our subconscious desires and projections drive our actions, leading to a yearning for a world where people can use their energies to their fullest positive use before projecting retroactively into all consciousness.

🎙️ The speaker reflects on the fear of death, the concept of forgiveness, and the need for faith in facing the unknown.
