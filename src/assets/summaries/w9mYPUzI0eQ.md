🗳️ The futility of predicting elections and the systemic break in American politics, with a focus on the disconnect between political parties and voters.

🗳 American politics are shaped by climate catastrophe, pandemic, and economic collapse, with Latino men leaning towards the Republican party due to toxic masculinity, while Democrats and Republicans have similar policies but different coding, and the experiences of race differ for Latinos and Black people.

🗳 Trump won the election despite pandemic and economic concerns, showing the inevitable division of the working-class republican party and the Democratic project being doomed.

🗳️ Liberals are deluded in thinking voting can stop moral horrors, the two-party system perpetuates a never-ending culture war, and the Democratic party's choices are dictated by the party's operating system rewired in the 1970s, leading to a shift towards re-centering the economy's profit engine inward and the demise of the working class.

🗳 American politics is shaped by private power, voter participation is important, and cultural resentment and lack of collective action are leading to a lack of challenge to the existing political structure.

🗳️ Politics as a sadistic game of voting, lacking class-based policies, with Brexit and the election settling fascism in America, leading to a divide ruled by elites.

🗣️ Change comes from external forces, not within the current system; China is an authoritarian state capitalist enterprise, and the speaker prefers backing China in future conflicts with the US.

🗳️ Reflecting on the impact of the election, staying grounded in reality, and breaking out of polarized politics to move forward.
